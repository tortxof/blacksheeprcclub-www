title: No Flying Over Pits and Parking Lot
---
Dear New BSRCC Member,

It is important to clearly point out that BSRCC does not allow any flying over
the pits and parking lot (i.e., where unprotected cars, members, visitors,
spectators, etc are located).  This is already covered in the bylaws, but is
important enough item to warrant mentioning separately for the following reasons
outlined below.

First, we are an AMA chartered club.  And, in order for the club insurance to
apply, AMA requires that acceptable site safety rules be set up to govern all
flying (i.e., safety in terms of both where one flies as well as how one flies).
BSRCC has such safety rules (patterned after the AMA rules) and they are
detailed in the club bylaws, which are available on the club web site
([www.bsrcc.com/bylaws/](https://www.bsrcc.com/bylaws/)).

Second, even apart from AMA requirements, the club officers themselves are
keenly aware of the need for site safety.  It takes but a little thought to
realize the great damage to club finances and morale that could result from an
accident involving an aircraft crashing into a car or, worse yet, into a fellow
member or visitor to the field.  It doesn't happen often, but a search of the
last few decades of modeling literature will show that deaths due to models
flying into people have indeed occurred.  A six pound model flying at fifty
miles per hour or so could easily kill a person if it hits them in the right
way&hellip; and I am certain that each of us would absolutely shudder at the
thought of that ever happening!

Third, is the recognition that we all participate in this hobby to enjoy both
the fun of flying our models, and the fellowship and camaraderie we have with
our friends.  Even modest observation will show that the most successful clubs,
in terms of longevity and membership numbers, are those that have: (a) a well
defined and enforced set of safety rules; and (b) a clearly understood code of
mutual courtesy which is expected of all its members.  BSRCC has long promoted
safety and courtesy among its members, and is currently a club which
simultaneously provides a well organized and safe site for members to fly their
models and also a relaxed and informal site where members can enjoy fun and
fellowship with their friends.  

Therefore, we kindly ask that you please help us in maintaining safety at our
flying site, and in promoting a positive flying site environment, by practicing
the following simple rules:

- Be familiar with and observe all club safety rules (i.e., a list of these are
  published in the club bylaws, which are available on
  [www.bsrcc.com](https://www.bsrcc.com/). These rules forbid flying over the
  pits and parking lot.).
- Be familiar with and observe the published club flight pattern (i.e., a club
  "flying site map" is posted on the bulletin board underneath the northern sun
  shed, and it clearly shows the allowable flight pattern).  
- Be courteous and respectful of your fellow members (i.e., "courteous" flying
  is also almost always "safe" flying).
- Be aware that you can always ask for flying help (i.e., if you are a
  relatively inexperienced flyer and perhaps unable to observe the published
  flight pattern, that's okay!  Just ask any of the experienced flyers present
  to help you until you are able to observe the published flight pattern. Asking
  for assistance or help is always an acceptable thing to do!).

With kindest regards,

JB Dansby, President  
For and on Behalf of the Officers
