<p>Black Sheep RC Club has been providing a quality Aero modeling experience since our founding in 1990.</p>

<p>We are located in Anderson, SC, not far from I-85.</p>

<p>We have a 40' by 300' asphalt runway, perfect for smaller electric models,
as well as an 800' grass runway for large models.</p>
