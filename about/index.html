<p>Black Sheep RC Club has been providing a quality aero modeling experience since our founding in 1990.</p>

<p>We are located in Anderson, SC, not far from I-85.</p>

<p>We have a 40' by 300' asphalt runway, perfect for smaller electric models,
as well as an 800' grass runway for large models.</p>

<p>Our goal as a club is to welcome new modelers to the hobby.
We are happy to help new people get started.</p>

<p>Club meetings are held on the first tuesday of every month at 6:00 PM.</p>
