## Meeting minutes from February 1, 2025.

Minutes accepted as read.

Treasurer's report accepted as read.

The club will host a fly-in on April 12 at the club field. Open to all AMA
members. No RSVP is required. There will be a $5 landing fee that includes
lunch. We will pick up pizza to serve for lunch.

Since many members and officers will be out of town for the [Perry swap
meet](https://www.gamarc.com/smsshow), there will be no March meeting. The next
meeting will be on April 5.

The annual club workday will be held on March 22.
