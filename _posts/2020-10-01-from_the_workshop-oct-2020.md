## Summary of Mar - Sep Club Meetings

July >> cancelled (Covid19)  
Aug >> cancelled (Covid19)

## Oct Club Meeting (Nomination of 2021 Officer Slate)

The Oct. club meeting will be held as indicated below.  "Social Distancing"
guidelines will be followed.

Date/Time/Place >> 06Oct2020, 6PM, Field Club House

1800 - 1830 hrs >> Dinner

1830 - 1900 hrs >> Business meeting

1900 - Whenever >> Hangar Flying, etc

Menu >> Pizza (provided by club)

The important thing to note for the October meeting is that this is the month
when officers are nominated for the next calendar year.  Any "adult member in
good standing" may nominate any other "adult member in good standing" to run for
an officer position.  The 6 jobs are President, Vice President, Treasurer,
Secretary, Safety Officer, & Field Marshall.  Nominations are usually made from
the floor at the Oct. meeting.  However, since some people have already said
they will not attend the Oct. meeting due to continued Covid concerns, we will
say that nominations may be made by either of the following methods: (a) oral
nomination from the floor at the Oct. meeting; or (b) written nomination via an
email sent to Bob Huff at <bobhuff1@charter.net> (Note, please no phone calls or
texts) at any time during the whole month of October and all the way up until
the voting time at the Nov. 3rd meeting.

## Nov Club Meeting (Election of 2021 Officers)

Our Nov. club meeting will be held as indicated below.  "Social Distancing"
guidelines will be followed.

Date/Time/Place >> 03Nov2020, 6PM, Field Club House

1800 - 1830 hrs >> Dinner

1830 - 1900 hrs >> Business meeting

1900 - Whenever >> Hangar Flying, etc

Menu >> Hamburgers (plus fixings)

The important thing to note for the November meeting is that this is the month
when officers are elected for the next calendar year.  Election of officers is
accomplished by majority vote of the members in attendance at the Nov. meeting.
Therefore, come out and join us if you possibly can.....you can get a great meal
& also vote for your favorite officers at the same time!  The three most
important work items for the 2021 officers are: (a) arrange to keep the field
mowed & maintained; (b) maintain club financial solvency; and (c) continue to
attract good quality members who like to fly & have fun!

## Dec Club Meeting (Annual Christmas Party)

We usually do not have a club meeting, per se, in the month of December.
Instead, we usually have a Christmas party/Christmas dinner at some restaurant
where we can enjoy a nice meal together and have some laughs by playing "dirty
santa gift exchange" (i.e., we exchange gifts of $15 value or less, and people
are allowed to "steal" other people's gifts).  We are unable to say at this time
whether we will have a Christmas party or not this year because we just don't
know what the Covid guidelines will be at that time (i.e., some people may not
want to attend, some restaurants may not want to accommodate a large group, etc,
etc).  Therefore, more detailed information concerning the Dec. meeting will be
given at a later date when more accurate Covid guidelines are available.

## Flying Site Is Open

We advise that the club flying site is indeed open for active flying, and the
usual Tue/Thur flying group is pretty much back to normal!  The flying field is
a pretty safe bet because it is easy to observe "social distancing" while at the
flying site.  Please come out and join those sessions if you can!  Or, if you
can't join those sessions, then feel free to fly any other day of the week that
you may like.  The site is always mowed and ready for flying any day you want to
come out!

## Status Of Lawn Mowers

Due to some recent maintenance, we have two workable Husqvarna's at this time.
However, the John Deere & the Troy Bilt are presently inoperable, and their age
makes it unlikely that they will ultimately be salvageable.  The two Husky's
will get us through the remainder of this year without any problem, and we will
keep our eyes open for another good used mower (that is also economical) to
potentially purchase in the next year.  Our treasury is currently in good shape
(see also related paragraph below) and, thus, buying a new mower should not be a
big problem.

## Our Club Is Financially Sound

As mentioned above, our club Treasury is in as good a shape as it has been in
several years.  This is due to a combination of the following reasons:

- Our Treasurer manages all expenditures very well!
- Lawn mower maintenance & repairs are done by volunteers.
- All site mowing is done by volunteers
- All ant treatments, weed spraying, building maintenance, & other related site
    maintenance items are also done by volunteers
- We've had some charitable donations from various members over the past year
    which significantly helped the Treasury

We are certainly happy to report our solid financial standing, and wish to say a
heartfelt thanks to all those members who have given of their "time, treasures,
& talents" over the past year to help make our club one of the finest in the
whole upstate area!

## No Dues Increase For 2021

Because of the fact that our club Treasury is currently in good shape, the
officers saw no need to even raise a discussion of increasing dues for calendar
year 2021.  Therefore, for 2021 dues will be the same as they have been over the
past several years (i.e., Adult member=$75/yr; Junior member=$25/yr; Disabled
member=$45/yr).  As you know, other similar clubs in the area have dues that are
significantly more than this, ranging from about $100 - $150 per year.  We
consider this a tremendous bargain.  Not only do we have one of the most
beautiful flying sites in the whole upstate region, members can enjoy this site
for lower membership dues than any other site in the general area!  As stated
above, our Treasury is in good shape because of two primary reasons: (a) all
site work/maintenance is done by volunteers; and (b) several members have given
unsolicited charitable donations to the club!

## Hunters On Site

We wish to remind all members that we are coming into the season where we will
have hunters on our site, in addition to those of us who will be there flying
models.  This has not caused any problem in the past because all the model
flying takes place at the extreme Eastern end of the property and all the
hunting takes place at the extreme Southwestern end of the property (the total
property is 76 acres, giving ample spacing).  Additionally, the officers have
tried to generally coordinate with the hunters to let them know where the flying
club members will be (i.e., around the runway, sheds & clubhouse) and to assure
them that we will respect their right to use their hunting lease.  Therefore, if
you are at the flying site and come into contact with some hunters, please
extend to them every possible courtesy, and then go about your flying as usual.
In case you have to go retrieve a model which has landed off-runway (i.e., in
the woods), please do not interfere with any "trail cams", "deer stands",
"hunting blinds", etc that you might come across.
