## Meeting minutes from March 1, 2022.

Minutes accepted as read.

Treasurer's report accepted as read.

Club workday will be held on March 19, with a makeup day of March 26 in the case
of bad weather. We plan to meet at the field at 9 AM. A steak and potato lunch
will be served at noon. If you are coming to the workday, please RSVP so that we
can have a steak ready for you. You can RSVP by sending an email to JB Dansby
<jbdansby@gmail.com> or Daniel Jones <tortxof@gmail.com>.

We are planning to let the RC car club use the club field for an upcoming drag
race event on April 22-24.

Dennis Beard will contact the RC car club and offer to let them use the club
field in exchange for them resurfacing/repairing the asphalt runway.
