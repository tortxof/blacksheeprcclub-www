## Bush Cutting

As you know, the open field surrounding the mowed runway has not been hayed for
the last couple of years. This allowed many bushes to spring up and some had
grown to heights of 4 - 8 ft. These bushes were recently chopped down with
machetes to prevent them from getting to larger heights and potentially
interfering with the model flying. The plan is to chop them down once annually
in the future to prevent them from regrowing.

## Possible Open Field Bush Hogging

To further improve the looks of the open field surrounding the mowed runway, and
to preserve the land as "cultivatable" for future use, attempts are being made
to get this area bush hogged. We will keep you posted as to how this turns out.

## Lawn Mowers

The winter months are used to generally perform lawn mower repairs & maintenance
in order to get them ready for the forthcoming year. The overall status of the
mowers is as follows: Two Huskies = fully functional Two Recently Donated Mowers
= being worked on (one being overhauled; the other needs new carb) Two Old
Mowers = Troy Bilt & John Deere are both nonfunctional & probably beyond repair.
Collectively, this puts us in good shape for next years' mowing needs.

## Miscellaneous Videos

If you happen to like agricultural airplanes (as I do), below are a couple of
links to the Air Tractor series of planes. The first link gets you to a youtube
video entitled "Air Tractor - Extreme Aerial Application - How Low Can You Go?".
The second link gets you to a video entitled "Air Tractor - Fire Boss In Action"
which shows the the Air Tractor 802 configured as a fire fighter (and beautiful
background scenery). Enjoy!
