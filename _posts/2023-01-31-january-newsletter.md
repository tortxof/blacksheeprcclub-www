## Meeting minutes from January 3, 2023.

Minutes accepted as read.

Treasurer's report accepted as read.

Currently we only have 1 good mower. There are funds of approximately $3-3.5k
than can be used to purchase a new mower for the club. JB will send a note to
members asking if they would like to donate to the mower fund.
