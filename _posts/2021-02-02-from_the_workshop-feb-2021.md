## Next Club Meeting (Tue, 02Feb2021)

We held the January club meeting with great success. Additionally, I am going to
assume that we are now pretty much back into a regular schedule of holding
future club meetings. Participants may exercise their own discretion concerning
use of masks and/or the practice of social distancing. Our next club meeting
will be held on Tue, 02Feb2021 (today), 6PM, at the field clubhouse. My
apologies for not getting this note/reminder out sooner, but it has been a busy
month @ the Dansby household (i.e., too many honeydo's)! The agenda is as
follows:

1800 - 1830 = dinner  
1830 - 1900 = business meeting  
1900 - whenever = "hangar flying"  
Menu = burgers, baked beans, potato salad, dessert.

Please come out and join us if you can for "food, fun, & fellowship"!

## Good Winter Flying

We always see a little reduction in flying activity during the winter months.
However, we will let everyone know that there is still a group of "die-hards"
that tend to fly *every* Tue/Thur if the weather permits. Actually, we have
started watching the weather and if Tue/Thur are bad with other days being good,
then we just fly on the good days! Here in beautiful, sunny South Carolina we
tend to fly all year long! There is always a note put out about the weekly
"flying sessions" and if you would like to be on the notification list just let
Nelson Swords <nelsonaswords@gmail.com> know and he will add you to the list.

## Important Reminders

1.  If you are a new BSRCC member, please familiarize yourself with the
    following documents found on our website at www.bsrcc.com:

    - "Club Bylaws"
    - "Noise, Overflight, and Flying site map"
    - "No Flying Over Pits and Parking Lot"

2.  Please check the status of your FAA registration and renew it if needed.

3.  Please check the status of your AMA membership and renew it if needed.

4.  Please check the status of your BSRCC membership and renew it if needed
    (i.e., 2021 membership dues may be mailed to Nelson Swords, 228 Ellison Lake
    Road, Williamston, SC 29697, Tel=864-940-5817, Email=
    <nelsonaswords@gmail.com>).

5.  Broken Prop Blades, Trash, Etc - in the interest of both safety and
    neatness, please help pick up broken prop blades and other debris when you
    see it at the field.

6.  Tree Climber - this person is generally available to climb trees for you to
    retrieve downed airplanes (i.e., Mr. Murray Holloway, tel= 864-671-9781).
    His fee is "negotiable".

That's all I have for now. See you @ the flying field!
