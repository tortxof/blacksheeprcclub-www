## Meeting minutes from August 4, 2015.

The meeting was called to order at 6:30 PM with seven members in attendance.

Last month's minutes were summarized and accepted without change.

The Treasurer's report was given. The Club's balance this month is $4438.68,
indicating the Club is in reasonable financial shape at this time.

The grass looks amazingly well, considering how hot it has been and the relative
lack of rain.

All starting benches now have new padding attached to the front of the uprights,
thanks to Morgan's hard work!

There were no safety incidents reported over the past month.

There was no old business left over from the prior month's meeting.

The club has decided to hold a "fly anything" fun fly on
Saturday, September 26, 2015. This fun fly is open to any who wish to attend,
and all types of flying models are welcome. This event will be advertised only
locally due to the relatively large expense and effort required to advertise in
the modeling magazines. Flyers to advertise the event are being prepared and
will be placed in the hobby shop, emailed to other local RC clubs, etc.

The meeting was adjourned at around 7:30 PM.

## Announcements

We are happy to welcome Bob Huff back to the field. Bob had an ankle replaced a
couple of months ago and has been recuperating since then. It is great to see
you back on two legs, Bob!

We want to thank Chris Huff for the wonderful caramel brownies she made for Bob
to bring to the field last Tuesday. Thanks so much Chris. We all enjoyed them
immensely!

The farmer's field around our flying site has been mowed, and hay bailing is in
progress. Please don't fly over any of the tractors or other machinery. This
work will only be going on for a short period of time, and we should be as
thoughtful and considerate of the workers as possible while this effort is under
way.
