## Nov Club Meeting (Election of 2021 Officers)

Our Nov. club meeting will be held as indicated below. "Social Distancing"
guidelines will be followed.

Date/Time/Place >> 03Nov2020, 6PM, Field ClubHouse  
1800 - 1830 hrs >> Dinner  
1830 - 1900 hrs >> Business meeting  
1900 - Whenever >> Hangar Flying, etc  
Menu >> Hamburgers (plus fixings)

The important thing to note for the November meeting is that this is the month
when officers are elected for the next calendar year. Election of officers is
accomplished by majority vote of the members in attendance at the Nov. meeting.
Therefore, come out and join us if you possibly can... you can get a great meal
& also vote for your favorite officers at the same time! The three most
important work items for the 2021 officers are: (a) arrange to keep the field
mowed & maintained; (b) maintain club financial solvency; and (c) continue to
attract good quality members who like to fly & have fun! Nominations may
continue to be made by either of the following methods all the way up until the
voting time at the Nov. 3rd meeting: (a) oral nomination from the floor at the
Nov. meeting; or (b) written nomination via an email sent to Bob Huff at
<bobhuff1@charter.net> (Note, please no phone calls or texts) at any time during
the whole month of October and up until the time of voting time at the Nov. 3rd
meeting.

## Dec Club Meeting (Annual Christmas Party)

We usually do not have a club meeting, per se, in the month of December.
Instead, we usually have a Christmas party/Christmas dinner at some restaurant
where we can enjoy a nice meal together and have some laughs by playing "dirty
santa gift exchange" (i.e., we exchange gifts of $15 value or less, and people
are allowed to "steal" other people's gifts). We plan to discuss this topic at
the Nov. meeting and the members will reach a decision as to whether or not they
wish to hold a Christmas dinner. We will notify everyone of the decision reached
in the immediate future so you can roll this into your holiday planning.

## Flying Site Is Open & Doing Well

As we advised previously, the club flying site is open and the Tue/Thur flying
group has recently had very active attendance. Please feel free to come out and
join these sessions if you can or, if you can't join these sessions, try to get
out any other time of the week and enjoy the flying. This is getting to be one
of the most beautiful times of the year in Upstate SC, and you should not miss
this grand flying weather!

## Additional Lawn Mower Donated to Club

We wish to thank James Barr for donating a Craftsman used mower to the club.
Right now it seems to have some carb problems, but that will hopefully be
resolved near future. Thanks, James, for thinking of the club in this regard.

## Status Of Lawn Mowers

No change in this area since last month (i.e., 5 total mowers currently owned by
club, 2 workable at this time, and 3 are being worked on). Site is always mowed
& ready for flying!

## Hunters On Site

We wish to again highlight that we are currently having hunters on the site at
this time of the year because they have leased hunting rights from the
landowner. The officers have tried to generally coordinate with the hunters to
let them know where the flying club members will be (i.e., around the runway,
sheds & clubhouse) and to assure them that we will respect their right to use
their hunting lease. Therefore, please extend to them every possible courtesy
when you see them on site. We have requested the hunters not drive ANY vehicles
on the runway, not do any mowing of any kind on the flying site areas, and not
to leave the gate unlocked after dark. They have said they will honor these
requests.

## Indoor Flying

enjoy it too!

## Moonrise Over Australia

This item has nothing to do with flying, but it came to me from a friend and I
found it very interesting. I thought you might enjoy it as well (click on URL
below)! "How many of you love a moon rise! A video from the Byron Bay lighthouse
at the northern tip of New South Wales, Australia. Because of its unique
geographical location, it can be seen and Photographed only locally. Enjoy the
moon rise for more than three minutes to witness the most beautiful view from
the easternmost part of Australia! A moon rise to be remembered for a long
time... to the music of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah."

That's all I have for now. See you @ the flying field!
