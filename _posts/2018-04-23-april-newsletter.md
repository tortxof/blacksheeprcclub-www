## Meeting minutes from April 3, 2018.

Minutes accepted as published.

Treasurer's report accepted as read.

The club workday on March 24 went well and all planned items were completed. The
field is in good shape for the summer flying season.

We recently lost the Cub Cadet lawn mower due to a fire resulting from a leaky
fuel line. No one was injured. The burned mower has been disposed of at the
county recycling center.
