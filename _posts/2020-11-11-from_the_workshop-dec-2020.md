## 2020 Annual BSRCC Christmas Party / 2020 Dec Club Meeting / 2021 Jan Club Meeting

As was stated in the Oct "From The Workshop" newsletter, an agenda item was
included in the Nov. meeting to discuss whether or not to hold the "Annual BSRCC
Christmas Party" this year. The argument in favor of having this event was that
it is generally a lot of fun! However, The arguments against holding it were:

- Many of our members are seniors, which automatically puts them in the Covid
  "high-risk" category
- Some members have additional health issues, which puts them in an even "higher
  risk" category
- Some restaurants are still hesitant to entertain large groups and, thus, they
  may not even want to accommodate us in any event

After some discussion on all these points, the group voted that the club would
NOT hold the annual BSRCC Christmas Party this year due to Covid concerns.
Additionally, everyone decided that the club would also NOT hold a Dec. club
meeting at the field clubhouse for the same reason. Therefore, our next club
meeting WILL be held the first Tue. of Jan. 2021, 6PM, at the field clubhouse so
be sure to put this on your calendar!

## 2021 BSRCC Officer Election Results

As you know, club ByLaws call for officers to be nominated at the October
meeting and then voted on for election in the November meeting. This process
was carried out resulting in the following officers for 2021:

- President - JB Dansby
- Vice President - Bob Huff
- Secretary - Daniel Jones
- Treasurer - Nelson Swords
- Safety Officer - Dennis Beard
- Field Marshall - Wade Calhoun

All officers thank you for your vote of confidence, and look forward to serving
you over the next year!

## Winter Flying

As you know, we fly all year long here in beautiful upstate South Carolina! In
fact, some claim the Fall/Winter flying weather is better than the Spring/Summer
weather. Although this topic is often debated, the fact remains that the coming
months will likely provide some very nice flying opportunities. Therefore,
please try to make some time to come out and join the rest of us "die hards" and
enjoy the great weather (Tue & Thur are common flying days)!

## Invite Your Friends To Come Fly With You

As you know, we have remained at about 40 members for many years now. Although
relatively small in numbers, we are a close knit group of modelers who enjoy
socializing together, flying together, and working together when required in
order to make our club one of the finest flying sites in South Carolina! To the
very last person, we take enormous pride in our flying site and we work hard to
maintain it in a clean, safe, and orderly manner. We know that many of our
members are also members of other flying clubs because it gives them a broader
base of friends to share the hobby with (an idea that has long been encouraged
by BSRCC). Therefore, we encourage all our members to invite their friends to
come fly with them at Black Sheep. Our rationale is that if you like them, then
chances are we will too! They can fly as your guests at BSRCC without feeling
any particular pressure to join. However, if they should wish to join at a
later time, then they are certainly welcome to do that as well! In any case,
our general goals at Black Sheep are to promote a relaxed environment where we
can enjoy each other's company, and to fly absolutely as much as the weather
permits!

## Mowers & More Mowers!

The club has fallen heir to yet another used mower (that makes us the proud
owner of 6 total mowers at this time)! This one was obtained by Morgan from one
of his neighbors because it had some mechanical problems. Dennis & Morgan are
planning to do the repairs over the winter months, thus giving us an additional
chance of winning the "grass battle" next year! Someone recently suggested that
we ought to re-name our club the "Black Sheep Lawn Mower & Incidental Flying
Club"! However, that suggestion was vigorously opposed by several senior
members who said that including "lawn mower" in the name would not reveal the
"true level of sophistication" of our club. Therefore, after much spirited
debate, we will proudly remain the Black Sheep RC Club (although we do have
almost as many mowers as we have airplanes)!

## A Pitts Description (author unknown)

This humorous "Pitts Description" (author unknown) was found online, and I
thought you might enjoy it as well.

> "The Pitts biplane can best be described as an infinite collection of oddly
> shaped curves which approximate an airplane, having wings and fuselage of
> extremely small aspect ratios thus giving rise to its maximal drag and minimal
> aerodynamic efficiency characteristics. This airplane is also noted for having
> two wings (when one would have done nicely) and oversized wheel pants (when
> none at all were needed), thus further decreasing its already dismal
> engine-out glide ratio ("...similar to a brick, as they say"). This airplane
> is a favorite among aerobatic pilots suffering from elevated testosterone
> levels, as well as those who tend to be obsessed with proving that both bumble
> bees and Pitts biplanes can, if fact, fly! To simply say that a Pitts biplane
> has a "lot of drag" would be a gross understatement of almost biblical
> proportions. In fact, one MIT professor who owns a 200 HP Pitts said that if
> the throttle is chopped rapidly while aloft, the normal Pitts drag is so high
> that it will actually cause the plane to fly backwards for a short while...
> before crashing! Notwithstanding any of the technical challenges mentioned
> above, the Pitts biplane is a treasured airplane to own as it imbues the title
> holder with almost unlimited bragging rights concerning any and all
> engineering, mechanical, aerodynamic, aerobatic, & airmanship matters! And
> that, my friends, in a nutshell, is why I own a Pitts!"

## Miscellaneous Videos

Below is a link to an interesting video that I have received over the past
month, and I thought you might enjoy it as well. It is entitled "Unconditional
Love" and shows the special bond that often develops between animals & humans of
all sorts. Enjoy! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaKtI4QfhH0>

That's all I have for now. See you @ the flying field!
