Our next club meeting will be held on Tue, 02Mar2021,
6PM, at the field clubhouse. The agenda is as follows:

1830 - 1900 = business meeting  
1900 - whenever = "hangar flying"  
Menu = sloppy joes >> Bob; chips >> Wade; potato salad >> Nelson; dessert >> JB.

Please come out and join us if you can for "food, fun, & fellowship"!

## Covid Update

We are pretty much back to a normal schedule concerning weekly flying and
monthly meetings. I am not aware of any members who have had Covid directly,
although several people have commented that they had family members who had
contracted it. Fortunately, all were relatively mild cases and seem to have
recovered quickly. People at the flying field continue to make their own
decisions concerning masks, social distancing, etc.

## Good Flying Weather Coming!

Well, if you have been out to the field lately you've probably noticed the grass
greening up! It appears we are on the verge of Spring popping out, so get those
batteries charged up and get out to the field for a little quality leisure time.
See you there!

## Annual Club Work Day

Saturday 20Mar is the planned annual club work day, with 27Mar as the alternate
date in case of rain. We plan to meet at the field at 9:00 AM and to be through
by about noon at the latest. All members are welcome to participate if they have
an interest, however, there is certainly no requirement to do so. The field is
actually in fairly good shape and so no real big work items remain to be taken
care of.

## Important Reminders

1.  If you are a new BSRCC member, please familiarize yourself with the
    following documents found on our website at www.bsrcc.com:

5.  Broken Prop Blades, Trash, Etc - in the interest of both safety and
    neatness, please help pick up broken prop blades and other debris when you
    see it at the field.

6.  Tree Climber - this person is generally available to climb trees for you to
    retrieve downed airplanes (i.e., Mr. Murray Holloway, tel= 864-671-9781).
    His fee is "negotiable".

That's all I have for now. See you @ the flying field!
