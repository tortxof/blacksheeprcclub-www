Treasurer's report accepted as read.

The club currently has 2 operational mowers. One is waiting on parts.

The club has received a quote for mowing the field at $123 per week, or about
$3K per year. It is still being decided if contracting out the mowing is
feasible.

A swap meet will be held at the club on September 17.
