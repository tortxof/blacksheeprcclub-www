## Meeting minutes from January 5, 2016.

Meeting called to order at 6:15 PM by J.B. Dansby.

Minutes were accepted as read.

A date of May 28 was accepted for an electric fly-in.
Dick Russell will CD the event, and Tony Denton will be the main organizer.

There was discussion of the new FAA UAS registration requirement.

Dick Russell gave the Treasurer's report.
The annual audit of the club's financial records was completed by a three member
panel and found to be in order.
The club members then thanked Nelson Swords for his past 8 years of diligent
service as Treasurer, and welcomed Dick Russel as the new Treasurer.

Dick Russel highlighted that the club's savings have been steadily decreasing
over the past few years due to increases in the cost of all maintenance related
items. Additionally, it was stated that the club's savings would be exhausted in
approximately three years unless club membership dues were raised to counteract
this trend. After some discussion, a proposal was made, and then seconded, to
change the membership dues in order to prevent further decline of the club's
finances. The membership dues structure would be changed to include only three
classifications. Adult membership (18 yrs. or older) at $75 per year, youth
membership (17 yrs. or younger) at $25 per year, and disabled membership at $45
per year. These changes would be made retroactive to January 1, 2016. A motion
was made to defer voting on these changes until the February meeting.

There were no safety issues to report.

The grass runway will need to be rolled this spring.
The condition of the gravel drive will be discussed at a future meeting.

## Additional notes on FAA registration.

AMA has recently sent out information to all of it's members suggesting that
they hold on registering at the present time to give AMA more time to discuss
with the FAA. However, it is unclear as to what might change over the next few
weeks, if anything, based on these planned additional AMA-FAA discussions. The
BSRCC position at this time is twofold. First, if members wish to take advantage
of the $5 rebate for early registration, they must [register
online](https://www.faa.gov/uas/registration/) with the FAA no later than
January 20, 2016. Second, unless the FAA changes their current ruling on the
matter, which is viewed as unlikely, all modelers must register with the FAA no
later than the stated deadline of February 19, 2016 in order to avoid being
subject to civil and/or criminal liabilities for flying without having
registered with the FAA. Since everyone at the meeting did not seem to be
getting all the AMA email distributions on this topic, JB will forward the
latest AMA correspondence on this subject to all members and this will contain
the information needed for each person to complete their registration online
with the FAA. Each person can then make their own decision as to whether they go
ahead and [register](https://www.faa.gov/uas/registration/) with the FAA right
now, or whether they wish to wait until closer to the FAA mandated deadline of
February 19, 2016.
