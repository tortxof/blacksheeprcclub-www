## Meeting minutes from January 5, 2016.

Meeting called to order at 6:15 PM by J.B. Dansby.

Minutes were accepted as read.

A date of May 28 was accepted for an electric fly-in.
Dick Russell will CD the event, and Tony Denton will be the main organizer.

There was discussion of the new FAA UAS registration.

Dick Russell gave the Treasurer's report.

After much discussion, Dick Russell made a proposal to change the membership
dues in order to prevent the further decline of the club's finances. The
membership dues structure would be changed to include only three
classifications. Adult membership at $75 per year, youth membership at $25 per
year, and disabled membership at $45 per year. These changes would be
retroactive to January 1, 2016. Motion was made to defer voting on these changes
until the February meeting.

There were no safety issues to report.

It was determined that the compactor does not belong to the club.

The condition of the gravel drive will be discussed at a future meeting after
all heavy work has been completed.

The existing berm should be adequate for the amount of target shooting taking
place at the club.

## Announcements

Morgan will be providing chili and cornbread for the February meeting.
