## Meeting minutes from February 2, 2016.

Meeting was called to order at 6:25 PM.

A work day in preparation for the fly-in will be held March 12, with a backup
day of March 19 in case of bad weather.

Daniel will make the flier for the fly-in after J.B. writes the copy.

The proposed dues changes were voted on and approved. The vote was unanimous in
favor of the changes. The changes are retroactive to January 1, 2016. There are
now only 3 membership classifications. Adult membership (18 yrs. or older) at
$75 per year, youth membership (17 yrs. or younger) at $25 per year, and
disabled membership at $45 per year.

Thank you J.B. for all of your hard work on the bylaws. The proposed bylaws will
be distributed to members and voted on at the March meeting.

Minutes from previous meeting were accepted as read.

Supplemental insurance has been paid. Treasurer's report was accepted as read.

Field report: Road repairs will be done as required at the March workday. Road

We welcomed a new member, David Snyder, to the club.
