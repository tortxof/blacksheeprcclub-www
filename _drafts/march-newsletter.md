## Meeting minutes from March 1, 2016.

Meeting was called to order at 6:30 PM.

Minutes from previous meeting were accepted as read.

We welcomed a new member, Harry Capps.

Treasurer's report was accepted as read.

At the next meeting we will discuss ways to attract new members to the club.

The revised bylaws were voted on and accepted.

Morgan reviewed the to-do list he has compiled for the club workday.

The club workday has been moved to March 19, due to a local fly-in already
occurring on the 12th. The backup day in case of bad weather is March 26. If you
are coming to the workday, please bring any small tools you may think are
needed.

[The Hobby Connection](http://www.hobbysc.com/) is planning a swap meet sometime
in May.
