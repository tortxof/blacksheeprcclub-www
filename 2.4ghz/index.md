title: 2.4GHz Announcement
---
To comply with current AMA safety guidelines, a proposal was made and seconded
at the [April meeting](/news/2015/04/10/april-newsletter/) to use only 2.4GHz
frequencies at the BSRCC field in the future (i.e., to discontinue usage of all
other previously used frequencies such as 27, 50, 72MHz). This proposal
was voted on at the [May meeting](/news/2015/05/11/may-newsletter/), and passed in favor of BSRCC going to
2.4GHz frequencies only. The vote was unanimous. This rule will go into effect
August 1, after which time only 2.4GHz frequencies may be used at the BSRCC
field. Members are informed by means of this announcement, and appropriate
signage will also be placed at the field.
