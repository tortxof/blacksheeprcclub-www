We have many excellent flyers in our club, and some specialize in landing
airplanes in trees. If you happen to be one of these skilled flyers, and are
also of such "golden age" that you no longer enjoy climbing the tree to retrieve
your airplane, then we know of a person who is available to do that task for
you.

Mr. Murray Holloway  
[864-361-7085](tel:+18643617085)

We do not readily know what his fee is, but we're sure he will apprise you of
this information if you call him.
