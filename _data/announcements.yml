  October is the month when we nominate the officers who will stand for election
  for the forthcoming year. Since our October meeting has been cancelled,
  everyone is invited to send their officer nominations to Daniel Jones via
  email (tortxof@gmail.com, daniel@bsrcc.com), text, telephone (864-431-7998),
  or written note (575 Edens Road, Pickens, SC 29671) any time during the month
  of October and up until the time of the November meeting. Daniel will collect
  all nominations and read them into the record at the November meeting. The
  officers thus nominated will be voted on by the membership at the November
  meeting, and majority vote will elect the officers for the 2022 calendar year.
