### President

The president shall preside at all club meetings, act as a spokesman for the
club, coordinate the duties of the other Club Officers, appoint special
temporary committees (including the audit committee) when and if they are
required, and act as an authorized signer (if necessary) of checks issued by the
Club. The president shall conduct his actions for the club in a democratic
fashion, strive hard to recognize, understand, and reflect the needs of all club
members, and in general be responsible for the smooth day to day running of the
club to the best of his ability. He shall also be responsible for the long range
planning necessary to ensure continuous availability of a suitable flying field
for the club. If the president is unable to attend a club meeting for any
reason, he shall appoint a Deputy (usually the Vice President) to act in his
stead.

### Vice President

The vice president shall act as Deputy for the President when he is not
available, and be responsible to the President for all other circumstances. At
each meeting, he shall give a report on old business from the prior meeting and
shall endeavor to have such business considered and voted on by the membership
in a timely fashion. He is also an authorized signer (if necessary) of checks
issued by the Club, and is responsible for the communications within the Club
outside of the areas of minutes and the Club newsletter. If the vice president
is unable to attend a club meeting for any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy
(usually the Treasurer) to act in his stead.

### Treasurer

The treasurer shall be responsible to the President, keep an accurate written
record of all financial affairs of the club, give a report at each meeting of
the current financial status of the club, collect and deposit all club dues,
frequently analyze the clubs long term financial situation and make
recommendations as how best to maintain solvency, act as liaison between the
club and the club's banking institution, keep an up to date record of the clubs
membership, and notify the club Secretary of membership status (e.g., those
members who are current on dues, delinquent on dues, AMA compliant, have
discontinued club membership, etc.). Additionally, he is the primary party
designated to act as an authorized signer of checks issued by the club. In the
event the Treasurer is unable to fulfill his duties for any reason (e.g.,
incapacitation, illness, out of town, etc.), the Vice President or President may
act in his stead with the same authority to sign checks. If the Treasurer is
unable to attend a club meeting for any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy
(usually the Vice President) to act in his stead.

### Secretary / Newsletter Editor

The Secretary shall be responsible to the President, give a report at each
meeting of the prior meeting minutes (noting any changes or corrections which
may be required), take accurate minutes of the ongoing club meeting, and publish
new minutes and the monthly club newsletter in a timely fashion. A copy of each
month's club minutes and newsletter shall be sent timely to each BSRCC member by
one of the following methods: (i) email (preferred method); or (ii) paper copy
(i.e., if that particular member does not have emailing capability). If the
Secretary cannot attend a club meeting for any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy
(usually the Treasurer) to act in his stead.

### Safety Officer

The Safety Officer shall be responsible to the President, ensure that all model
flying is conducted in a safe manner (i.e., in accordance with all AMA safety
rules and club safety rules), and shall give a report on the clubs general
safety status at each meeting. Additionally, he shall be the first point of
contact with any member(s) who might fly in an unsafe manner, in hopes that
voluntary compliance with all safety rules can then be achieved. If not, he
shall report such incidents to the Board of Officers for further discussion and
consideration, and appropriate action as may be necessary. If the Safety Officer
cannot attend a club meeting for any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy (usually
the Field Marshall) to act in his stead.

### Field Marshall

The Field Marshall shall be responsible to the President, and shall ensure that
all field safety equipment (e.g., spectator safety fences, impound area, safety
bulletin board, plane holding stations, plane assembly benches, pilot standing
areas, pilot safety fences, etc.) is maintained in such manner as to meet all
safety standards of both the AMA and the BSRCC. Additionally, he shall ensure
that all field maintenance equipment (i.e., lawn mowers, weed eaters, etc.), and
the field itself, are maintained in an acceptable condition to accommodate the
usual model flying. He shall report on the general field status at each meeting,
noting any deficiencies which are found, and shall organize assistance from any
and all other BSRCC members as may be required in order to maintain the desired
level of field maintenance for supporting an active flying club. It is expected
that all members will respond positively to any request by the Field Marshall
for any assistance with field maintenance work. If the Field Marshall cannot
attend a club meeting for any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy (usually the
Safety Officer) to act in his stead

### Board of Officers

The Board of Officers shall consist of the collective officers of the BSRCC
described above. In addition to their individual duties, the Board of Officers
shall also have the collective responsibility to collaborate and cooperate with
each other regarding the following global items related to club operations: (i)
all safety at the field (flying and nonflying); (ii) day to day club
maintenance, especially runway condition; (iii) day to day club operations
(flying and nonflying); (iv) planning and execution of all club flyins, funflys,
and competitions (if any), and sanctioning of same with AMA (if required); (v)
long range planning necessary to ensure continuous availability of a suitable
flying field for the club; and (vi) to consider and take appropriate action on
any and all matters related to member discipline.

## ARTICLE V --- ANNUAL ELECTION OF OFFICERS {#v}

Nominations and election of club officers shall be carried out each year as
described below.

### Nominations

Nominations shall be made from the floor at the October club meeting for each
officer position, and shall be made from only those members who satisfy all of
the following criteria at the time of nomination: (i) they are 18 years of age
or older, (ii) they are current on payment of all club dues, (iii) they are not
under disciplinary action for violation of any club rule, and (iv) they have
been a member in good standing of BSRCC for a minimum of one calendar year or
longer. Additionally, a given person may be nominated for only one officer
position at any given time (i.e., no person shall be nominated to run for two
officer positions simultaneously). The names of those members nominated for the
various officer positions shall be published and highlighted in the October
newsletter.

### Election

Election of new officers shall be held at the November club Meeting, from those
who have been nominated as per above, by means of majority vote of the members
present at that meeting. The resulting new officer's names shall be published
and highlighted in the November meeting newsletter.

### Terms of Office

Officers are elected for a one year time period, and shall serve from January 1
through December 31 of the forthcoming year. There shall be no term limitations
on any officer position (i.e., a given club member may serve multiple times in a
particular officer position provided that he is duly nominated and elected each
year by a majority vote of the membership).

## ARTICLE VI --- CLUB MEETINGS {#vi}

Regular BSRCC Club Meetings shall be held on the first Tuesday of every month at
6:30 PM, and at a location which is stated in the prior month's newsletter
and/or on the club's web site at <https://www.bsrcc.com>. Meetings are typically
held at the flying field club house. Additionally, Special Called Meetings may
be organized by the club President, if and when necessary, with adequate prior
notification to the membership.

## ARTICLE VII --- RECORD KEEPING {#vii}

Treasurer and Secretary records shall be maintained for a period of 7 years,
after which time they may be disposed of. The outgoing Treasurer and Secretary
shall be responsible for transferring their complete historical records to the
incoming Treasurer and Secretary who, in turn, shall be responsible for
receiving and taking custody of same. This transfer of records is usually done
immediately following completion of the annual financial audit, performed on the
schedule described below. All records are the property of the BSRCC.

## ARTICLE VIII --- AUDIT AND SPECIAL COMMITTEES {#viii}

### Audit Committee

For transparency reasons, the outgoing President shall at the December meeting
appoint two sitting club Officers plus one other club Member to audit the
Treasurer's financial records for the past fiscal year. This committee shall
conduct its audit of the records no later than the following January, discuss
with the past Treasurer as may be needed in order to fully understand the clubs
financial records, review its preliminary findings with the past Treasure to
achieve concurrence on the conclusions, and then report the final audit
conclusions to the club's general membership no later than the January club
meeting. The Secretary shall publish the audit results in the January club
newsletter. The audit committee shall be automatically disbanded following
completion of the audit report.

### Special Committees

Special committees, if needed for any reason, may be appointed by the President
at any club meeting. These committees shall operate under a specific charter,
and for a specific time period defined by the President, and shall be
automatically disbanded when their duties are completed.

## ARTICLE IX --- GENERAL CLUB RULES {#ix}

### Safety Rules

It is not feasible to make a complete and exhaustive listing of all safety and
operational club rules that will make a model flying site function both safely
and smoothly. However, history and experience are of great assistance in this
endeavor, and the below list of items has been compiled based on the BSRCC's
many years of prior club experience. These safety rules and guidelines are
provided for the general benefit of all members, and are as follows:

- All published AMA safety rules must be obeyed at all times.
- All published BSRCC safety rules must be obeyed at all times.
- If there should happen to be a conflict or difference between the published
  AMA and published BSRCC safety rules, then the more conservative of the two
  (i.e., the safest) shall take precedence.
- For any circumstance in which a safety rule has not been published by either
  AMA or BSRCC, then the club member shall always exercise good, safe, sound,
  and mature judgment (i.e., he shall always err on the side of conservatism and
  constantly strive to reduce risk in all matters related to safety).
- To comply with AMA guidelines concerning both safety and frequency management,
  the club has recently voted to allow only 2.4 GHz transmitter frequencies in
  the future. Therefore, the older transmitter frequencies (e.g., 27, 49, 53, 72
  MHz, etc.) are no longer allowed at the BSRCC field. A transmitter impound
  area still exists, but is not required during normal day to day flying
  sessions. However, the transmitter impound area may still be used for
  fun-flys, fly-ins, competitions, etc. if the CD in charge determines it is
  necessary.
- No alcoholic beverages are allowed on the BSRCC flying site at any time.
- No illegal drugs are allowed on the BSRCC flying site at any time. Regarding
  the issue of flying while taking legal drugs or medicines prescribed by
  licensed medical practitioners, the following is offered as general guidance.
  If the prescribed medication does not result in impaired mental, visual, or
  physical function, then the member may fly. However, if the prescribed
  medication does result in impaired mental, visual, or physical function, then
  the member shall not fly. In this instance, each member is required to: (a)
  "self-certify"; and (b) to consult with their personal licensed medical
  provider if any further guidance is needed to determine the safe course of
  action.
- A member may fly only if: (a) they possess a current and valid AMA card; and
  (b) they are a BSRCC member in good standing (i.e., not delinquent or under
  disciplinary action).
- A guest or a prospective member may fly only if: (a) they possess a current
  and valid AMA card; and (b) they are accompanied by a BSRCC member in good
  standing. The host BSRCC member is responsible for the guest's flying and
  nonflying actions while at the club. A host BSRCC member may have a maximum of
  twelve guest visits during any one calendar year, with no more than three
  guests being in attendance on any one calendar day.
- Both fixed wing aircraft and rotor wing aircraft are welcome at BSRCC. All
  flyers at the BSRCC site are expected to always display courtesy and
  cooperation with their fellow club members and visitors, and to "share the
  flying time equally" amongst all those present at any given time. For those
  flyers who might need extended hovering and/or engine tuning times, please use
  the quadrant of the field located to the south and west of the southernmost
  metal sun shed so as to free up the main runway.
- Before attempting to fly solo, new pilot members (i.e., "students") are
  invited and encouraged to seek flying assistance from the more experienced
  club members (i.e., "instructors") until they reach the point where they can
  reliably and safely takeoff, fly, and land unassisted (i.e., "fly solo"). The
  club has numerous experienced members who are willing to help newcomers, and a
  subsequent section (entitled "Recommended Solo Pilot Qualification Procedure")
  is provided as general guidance to assist both the newcomer and the
  experienced flyer in determining when transition to solo flight is
  appropriate, for both fixed wing aircraft and rotor wing aircraft.
- No motors or engines shall be operated on the spectator side of the field's
  safety fence.
- There shall be no more than five total fliers in the air at the same time.
  When three or more pilots are flying simultaneously, it is considered good
  practice to have a separate nonflying safety observer on the field, if
  possible.
- All AMA guidelines prohibiting flight over or directly toward pilot, pit, and
  spectator areas shall be rigorously adhered to. More specifically, when a
  model is under significant power and flying in close proximity to the runway,
  the pilot of such model shall ensure that its flight path is not over these
  areas nor directed toward them. This would include the following specific
  circumstances: (a) during the takeoff run; (b) when a landing approach is
  missed and a go around is necessary; (c) when repeated touch and go landings
  are being performed; (d) when high speed, low altitude passes are being
  performed; (e) when low level aerobatic routines or maneuvers are being
  performed; (f) when any other flight maneuver is being performed that places
  the model in close proximity to the runway. Note that this requirement does
  not apply to the landing approach/turn, which will also have flight path
  momentarily directed toward the runway, pilot, pits, and spectator areas,
  because such maneuver will typically be made at a significant distance away
  from these areas and will also usually be at low or idle power setting.
- Regarding the issue of a pilot desiring to approach the runway to retrieve an
  engine out model (e.g., engine quits on runway) while other pilots are still
  flying, the pilot shall first check to see if this is safe (i.e., no other
  flying models in close proximity to runway). If it is safe, then he shall
  loudly call out "on the runway" when approaching the runway, and then "clear
  of runway" when departing the runway after retrieving the model. This will
  enable other airborne flyers to safely avoid the runway during the period of
  time that the model is being retrieved.
- All engine out (dead stick) landings shall have priority to the runway. To
  ensure that other currently airborne flyers will be aware of his immediate
  need for priority, the pilot of the engine out model shall loudly call out
  "dead stick". After the dead stick landing has been completed, the pilot of
  the engine out model shall follow the safety procedure described above when
  approaching the runway to retrieve the model.
- Restricted air space shall be as posted on the field's bulletin board (i.e.,
  pilots shall not overfly the property of adjoining landowners).
- At completion of a flying session for the day, the last member leaving the
  field shall close and securely lock the main gate in order to protect the
  clubs facilities.

### Other Rules

BSRCC is much more than just a physical place to fly ones model airplane.
Rather, it is viewed by the current membership as a highly enjoyable and
picturesque place to fly ones model airplane, and also a place where club
members with a common aeromodeling interest can gather socially, share technical
knowledge, train novice pilots, enjoy camaraderie and fellowship amongst
themselves, have a laugh or two, and generally participate in an atmosphere
which is both safe and mutually supportive of all members who wish to enjoy this
wonderful hobby. Therefore, all club members are kindly requested to keep flying
safety first and foremost in their minds, and also to project an honest,
friendly, cooperative, courteous, and positive attitude to all other club
members, adjoining land owners, the public at large, and visitors to the field.

## ARTICLE X --- PROCEDURE FOR VIOLATION OF CLUB RULES {#x}

[Article II](#ii) above states that the purpose of the BSRCC is to provide the
physical facilities, safety rules, operational procedures, and general
management structure to enable the Membership to safely engage in and enjoy the
hobby of Model Aviation. [Article IX](#ix) above states specific safety rules
for the BSRCC flying site, and also gives general guidance on expected courteous
behavior while at the flying field. The sum total of these two Articles means
that each and every member is expected to adhere to accepted norms of societal
behavior concerning safety, honesty, courtesy, cooperation, inclusiveness, and
friendliness such that their actions will tend to enable, promote, and assist
all other members in engaging in and enjoying the hobby of model aviation,
rather than inhibiting, discouraging, or preventing other members from engaging
in and enjoying the hobby of model aviation.

This Article X, then, provides a mechanism to enforce the above club rules,
should it ever be required. This mechanism of enforcement will typically follow
one or all of the following three steps, which will be carried out as necessary
for reasons of safety and/or club stability.

### First Violation

For a first time, minor, accidental, or inadvertent violation of the above
rules, the club Safety Officer acting after discussions and concurrence with the
Board of Officers will privately, orally, and informally mention to the
offending member what actions need to be corrected in order to be in keeping
with accepted club norms. It is expected that the club member will then modify
his behavior accordingly, and the situation is considered to be completely
resolved with no further actions being required. This step will require that at
least one club member in good standing have direct knowledge of the infraction,
and be willing to so testify.

### Second Violation

For a second time, more serious, willful, or purposeful violation of the above
rules, the club Safety Officer acting after discussions and concurrence with the
Board of Officers will in writing notify the offending member what actions need
to be corrected in order to be in keeping with accepted club norms, and that
failure to correct such actions in future will lead to his expulsion from the
club. It is expected that the club member will then modify his behavior
accordingly. This step will require that at least two club members in good
standing have direct knowledge of the infraction, and be willing to so testify.

### Third Violation

For a third time, highly serious, or blatantly defiant violation of the above
rules, the club President acting after discussions and concurrence with the
Board of Officers will in writing notify the offending member that he is to
appear before the Board of Officers to defend and/or explain his actions for not
following the club rules. This step will require that at least three club
members in good standing have direct knowledge of the infraction, and be willing
to so testify and discuss with the Board of Officers. Following discussion from
the club members in good standing who have direct knowledge of the infraction,
and defense/explanation by the offending member of his actions, the Board of
Officers shall decide by majority vote whether: (i) the offending member is to
be expelled from the club; (ii) the offending member may remain a club member
with no constraints/restrictions; or (iii) the offending member may remain a
club member but with certain constraints/restrictions as may be prescribed by
the Board of Officers. Whatever decision is reached by the Board of Officers,
such decision is final and shall not be subject to question, negotiation, or
further appeal. The decision by the Board of Officers shall be clearly
communicated in writing to the offending member. If a member is expelled for
serious or repeated infraction of club rules, no refund of "unused dues" shall
be made.

## ARTICLE XI --- DISSOLUTION OF CLUB {#xi}

If desired for any reason, the club may be dissolved by majority vote of the
then current Membership who are eligible to vote (i.e., members who are more
than 18 years of age, not delinquent on dues, and not under disciplinary
action). If such action is taken, the Officers shall then: (i) make provisions
for payment of all the Club's legally owed debts; and (ii) dispose of all
remaining Club assets, if any, in a manner which is equitable to all members.

## ARTICLE XII --- MEMBERSHIP APPLICATIONS, RENEWALS, DUES, AND ASSESSMENTS {#xii}

### New Membership Applications

BSRCC has open membership which is generally available to all persons interested
in model aviation provided they are of good, safe, honest, cooperative,
courteous, and friendly reputation. A New Membership Application Form is
available on the Club's website at <https://www.bsrcc.com>, and contains all
instructions required for completing and submitting the application.

### Existing Membership Renewals

For existing members, annual dues are due and payable on January 1 of each year,
and are considered delinquent after that date. Existing members may conveniently
renew their membership by the following process: (i) make a photocopy of your
current and valid AMA card; (ii) write on the front of it your applicable
membership class; (iii) attach a check for the applicable annual dues amount;
and (iv) mail all these items to the current club Treasurer (address information
is available at <https://www.bsrcc.com>). Any existing membership which is not
renewed by February 28 of a given year will be sent an email reminder of the
delinquency. Any existing membership which is not renewed by March 31 of a given
year will be considered as voluntarily relinquished and dropped from the club
roster.

### Annual Dues Amount

The current and applicable Annual Dues Amount for each Membership Class is shown
on the New Membership Application Form, for both New Membership Applications and
Existing Membership Renewals. New Membership Annual Dues Amount may be prorated
depending on which month they join in (see New Membership Application Form for
details), however, Existing Membership Annual Dues Amount shall not be prorated.

### Special Assessments

"Special Assessments", which are intended to address emergency, unusual, and/or
extraordinary events, may potentially be proposed and accepted by the membership
from time to time. Examples of such events might be the replacement of a stolen
lawnmower, having the field rent unexpectedly raised, having to replace a field
shed damaged by weather, or similar such events. If any special assessments are
accepted by the membership per majority vote at a scheduled club meeting, then
the individual assessment amount levied on each member shall be equal to the
total special assessment amount divided by the total number of members in the
club at that time.

## ARTICLE XIII --- MEMBER VOTING RIGHTS {#xiii}

Voting rights within the BSRCC are limited to only those members who are
eighteen years of age or older, and who are also fully paid up members in good
standing (i.e., youth members, members delinquent on dues, and members under
disciplinary action are not allowed to vote).

## ARTICLE XIV --- RECOMMENDED SOLO PILOT QUALIFICATION PROCEDURE {#xiv}

Like most RC flying clubs, BSRCC does not have a formal process for teaching new
members of the club how to fly model airplanes. Instead, this process is handled
informally with the more experienced members simply helping the less experienced
members become proficient and safe at model building and flying. In this regard,
the more experienced members are usually referred to as "instructors", and the
new members are generally referred to as "students". This initial teaching
process is justified for reasons of both safety (i.e., to prevent possible
injury to the student and/or other persons at the field) and economy (i.e., to
prevent expensive crashes of the student's airplane or rotor craft). This
teaching process continues until such time as the student "solos" (i.e., becomes
capable of flying unassisted), at which time the "instructor" and the "student"
both become "members" again.

In an effort to assist both the instructor and the student in determining when
the student is ready to solo (i.e., ready to fly unassisted), the following
recommended guidelines and check list items have been compiled by several senior
members who have previously served as instructors. If the student can
consistently and reliably perform all the maneuvers listed in the
guidelines/checklist below, within an approximately 10 minute flying session,
under the overall supervision of a club instructor, then he can have a high
degree of confidence that he is ready to safely solo his aircraft (i.e., fly
unassisted and independently). These recommendations are given below for both
fixed wing and rotor wing aircraft.

### Recommended Guidelines and Checklist Items for Fixed Wing Aircraft

- conduct appropriate preflight aircraft inspection (i.e., mechanical checks)
- conduct appropriate TX/RX range checks
- controlled fuel up of aircraft
- controlled and safe startup of engine, and perform required tuning
- controlled and safe transport (i.e., carry) of aircraft from pits to runway

## ARTICLE XV --- RESIGNATION OF CLUB MEMBERSHIP {#xv}

If desired for any reason, a club member may resign his membership in the BSRCC
by mailing written notification to the club Treasurer at the same address as is
used for mailing the annual dues (i.e., written notification includes any
convenient means of correspondence such as email, typed letter, handwritten
note, etc.). The resigning member shall not be entitled to refund of any "unused
dues" at the time of resignation.

## ARTICLE XVI --- AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS {#xvi}

Amendments to the bylaws may be accomplished by the following process. Any
proposed amendment to the bylaws shall be presented at a regularly scheduled
monthly meeting (or special called meeting), then discussed and explained with
regards to its advantages and disadvantages. If the proposed amendment is then
seconded, it shall be entered into that month's meeting minutes and circulated
to all members for their general information. This proposed amendment shall then
be reviewed and summarized at the next regularly scheduled monthly meeting (or
special called meeting), further discussed if needed, and then voted on by the
membership. An Amendment shall be considered approved if accepted by majority
