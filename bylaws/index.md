## ARTICLE II --- PURPOSE OF CLUB {#ii}

The purpose of the BSRCC shall be to provide the physical facilities, safety
rules, operational procedures, and general management structure to enable the
Membership to safely engage in and enjoy the hobby of Model Aviation.


## ARTICLE III --- DEFINITIONS {#iii}

"Black Sheep Radio Control Club, Inc." shall mean the nonprofit model flying
club organized and incorporated in the state of South Carolina, USA. Mailing
address and field location are given above.

"BSRCC" shall mean the Black Sheep Radio Control Club, Inc.

"Member" shall mean any person who belongs to the BSRCC by virtue of having
satisfied all of the following requirements:

{: type="i"}
1.  he/she has expressed an interest in model aviation
2.  he/she has paid all required annual membership dues
3.  he/she holds a current AMA membership card
4.  he/she is also considered to be a person of good and honest reputation
    (i.e., has not been previously expelled by this or another similar club for
    infraction of stated club rules)
5.  he/she has expressed a willingness to participate, along with other club
    members, in any general field maintenance activities which may be
    periodically requested by the Field Marshall (e.g., the annual club work day).

BSRCC is an AMA Chartered Club and, thus, current and valid AMA membership is
required in order to be a BSRCC member. If a member's AMA membership expires,
then the BSRCC membership automatically expires as well. In this instance, BSRCC
membership can only be reinstated after AMA membership is reinstated. Individual
club members are kindly requested to conduct all their flying activities in a
safe manner (i.e., in accordance with all BSRCC and AMA safety rules), and to
project a friendly, cooperative, and courteous attitude to adjoining land
owners, the public at large, visitors to the field, and to all other club
members.

"Membership" shall mean the collective members of the BSRCC.

"He" shall mean in the remainder of these Bylaws the more correct term "he/she".
This is in recognition of the fact that those interested in model aviation may
be either male or female, and both are equally welcomed by the BSRCC.

"Majority Vote" shall mean the numerical majority of all members present at a
regularly scheduled monthly meeting.


## ARTICLE IV --- OFFICERS AND ASSOCIATED DUTIES {#iv}

Officer nominations are made at the October club meeting, notification to the
membership of those nominated for each officer position is made in the October
minutes/newsletter, and then elections are held at the November club meeting.
The term "Officer" shall mean a club member who is nominated and elected for one
(and only one) of the officer positions described below, by majority vote of the
club membership that is present at the November club meeting. Officers are
elected for a one year time period, and shall serve from January 1 thru December
31 of the forthcoming year. The officer positions of BSRCC, and associated
primary duties, are described below.

### President

The president shall preside at all club meetings, act as a spokesman for the
club, coordinate the duties of the other Club Officers, appoint special
temporary committees (including the audit committee) when and if they are
required, and act as an authorized signer (if necessary) of checks issued by the
Club. The president shall conduct his actions for the club in a democratic
fashion, strive hard to recognize, understand, and reflect the needs of all club
members, and in general be responsible for the smooth day to day running of the
club to the best of his ability. He shall also be responsible for the long range
planning necessary to ensure continuous availability of a suitable flying field
for the club. If the president is unable to attend a club meeting for any
reason, he shall appoint a Deputy (usually the Vice President) to act in his
stead.

### Vice President

The vice president shall act as Deputy for the President when he is not
available, and be responsible to the President for all other circumstances. At
each meeting, he shall give a report on old business from the prior meeting and
shall endeavor to have such business considered and voted on by the membership
in a timely fashion. He is also an authorized signer (if necessary) of checks
issued by the Club, and is responsible for the communications within the Club
outside of the areas of minutes and the Club newsletter. If the vice president
is unable to attend a club meeting for any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy
(usually the Treasurer) to act in his stead.

### Treasurer

The treasurer shall be responsible to the President, keep an accurate record of
all financial affairs of the Club, give a report at each meeting of the current
financial status of the club, collect and deposit all Club dues, act as liaison
between the Club and the Club's banking institution, keep an up to date record
of the clubs membership, and notify the club Newsletter Editor of membership
status (i.e., those members who are paid up, delinquent, have dropped out,
etc.). He may also act as an authorized signer (if necessary) of checks issued
by the Club. If the Treasurer is unable to attend a club meeting for any reason,
he shall appoint a Deputy (usually the Vice President) to act in his stead.

### Secretary

The Secretary shall be responsible to the President, give a report at each
meeting of the prior meeting minutes (noting any changes or corrections which
may be required), take accurate minutes of the ongoing Club meeting, and publish
new minutes and the monthly club newsletter in a timely fashion. A copy of each
month's club minutes and newsletter shall be sent timely to each BSRCC member by
one of the following methods: (i) email (preferred method); or (ii) paper copy
(i.e., if that particular member does not have emailing capability). If the
Secretary cannot attend a club meeting for any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy
(usually the Treasurer) to act in his stead.

### Safety Officer

The Safety Officer shall be responsible to the President, ensure that all model
flying is conducted in a safe manner (i.e., in accordance with all AMA safety
rules and Club safety rules), and shall give a report on the clubs general
safety status at each meeting. Additionally, he shall be the first point of
contact with any member(s) who might fly in an unsafe manner, in hopes that
voluntary compliance with all safety rules can then be achieved. If not, he
shall report such incidents to the Board of Officers for further consideration
and appropriate action. If the Safety Officer cannot attend a club meeting for
any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy (usually the Field Marshall) to act in his
stead.

### Field Marshall

The Field Marshall shall be responsible to the President, and shall ensure that
all field safety equipment (e.g., spectator safety fences, impound area, safety
bulletin board, plane holding stations, plane assembly benches, pilot standing
areas, pilot safety fences, etc.) is maintained in such manner as to meet all
safety standards of both the AMA and the BSRCC. Additionally, he shall ensure
that all field maintenance equipment (i.e., lawn mowers, weed eaters, rakes,
shovels, etc.), and the field itself, are maintained in an acceptable condition
to accommodate the usual model flying. He shall report on the general field
status at each meeting, noting any deficiencies which are found, and shall
organize assistance from any and all other BSRCC members as may be required in
order to maintain the desired level of field maintenance for supporting an
active flying club. (Note: it is expected that all members will respond
positively to the Field Marshall's request for any assistance with field
maintenance work).

### The Board of Officers

The Board of Officers shall consist of the collective officers of the BSRCC
described above. In addition to their individual duties, the Board of Officers
shall also have collective responsibility for the following global items related
to club operations: (i) all safety at the field (flying and nonflying); (ii)
establishing and obtaining membership approval of the clubs annual budget
(usually submitted in January and approved by the membership in February); (iii)
day to day club maintenance, especially runway condition; (iv) day to day club
operations (flying and nonflying); (v) planning and execution of all club
flyins, funflys, and competitions (if any), and sanctioning of same with AMA (if
required); (vi) long range planning necessary to ensure continuous availability
of a suitable flying field for the club; and (vii) to consider and take
appropriate action on any and all matters related to member discipline. The
Board of Officers may authorize club expenditures for any previously approved
budget line item (up to the approved amount), and an emergency expenditure up to
$150 (e.g., for lawn mower repairs, etc.). However, any emergency expenditure
over this amount must be considered, discussed, voted on, and accepted by
majority vote of the membership prior to making the expenditure.


## ARTICLE V --- ANNUAL AUDIT {#v}

The outgoing President shall at the December meeting appoint two sitting
club Officers plus one other regular club Member to audit the Treasurer=E2=
=80=99s
financial records for the past fiscal year. This committee shall conduct
its audit of the records timely (typically in January), discuss with the
past Treasurer as may be needed in order to fully understand the clubs
financial records, review its preliminary findings with the past Treasure
to achieve concurrence on the conclusions, and then report the final audit
conclusions to the club's general membership no later than the February
meeting. The Secretary/Newsletter Editor shall publish the audit results in
the next club minutes/newsletter, and the audit committee shall be
automatically disbanded following completion of the audit report.



*ARTICLE VI --- MEMBERSHIP CLASSIFICATIONS, DUES, AND SPECIAL ASSESSM=
ENTS *

BSRCC has *open membership* which is generally available to all persons of
good and honest reputation who are interested in model aviation. The
fiscal year of BSRCC shall coincide with the calendar year, January 1 to
December 31.



BSRCC has several *membership classifications*, and varying *annual dues*
are associated with each one. Renewing members as well as new members must
indicate on their renewal/joining form which classification they are
renewing or joining for. These classifications and their associated dues
are indicated in the following table. All membership classifications have
equal rights with regard to flying site access and utilization.



*Membership *

*Classification*

*Annual Dues --- payable by *

*January 1 each year* (1,2,3,4,5)

Junior Member

(i.e., a member who is less than 22 years of age if enrolled as a full time
student at an institution of higher learning, or less than 18 years of age
if not)

$45

Adult Member

(i.e., a member who is between the ages of 18 and 65, and who

cannot qualify as a Junior Member per above definition)

$75

Senior Member

(i.e., a member who is 65 years of age or older)

$45

Disabled Member

(i.e., a member of any age who has been diagnosed as

"disabled" by a licensed medical doctor)

$45

(i.e., a full member of another AMA Chartered RC Club whose field is
located within a radius of 50 miles of the BSRCC field)

$45

Family Membership

(i.e., two or more members of any age who are legally related to one
another)

"Family Membership" shall enjoy a

10% discount from above dues rates

Honorary Membership

(i.e., an honorary and permanent membership which is conferred in
recognition of a person's exceptional service to the Club)

$0

*Footnotes>*

(1) If an existing member renews in January, February, or March, a
"late payment penalty" of $0 is added to the annual dues amount shown above
(i.e., this is a grace period granted by the club).

(2) If an existing member renews in April, May, or June, a "late
payment penalty" of $15 is added to the annual dues amount shown above.

(3) If an existing member renews in July, August, or September, a "late
payment penalty" of $30 is added to the annual dues amount shown above.

(4) If an existing member renews in October, November, or December, a
"late payment penalty" of $45 is added to the annual dues amount shown
above.

(5) Annual dues are prorated for new members only, and do not apply to
annual renewal by existing members. Existing members must pay the entire
years' annual dues, regardless of the time of the year in which they
renew. Any membership which is not renewed for a period of 1 year shall be
considered cancelled, and shall be dropped from the membership roster.





For *new members*, annual membership dues are due and payable at the time
of joining. For the first year of new membership, dues will be prorated
depending on the actual month of joining (i.e., depending on how many
months are left to be "used" in that fiscal year). For example, if a new
member joins in January then the dues for that first year will be
(12/12)x(annual dues amount for the applicable member classification), and
if he joins in December then the first year dues will be (1/12)x(annual
dues amount for the applicable member classification). All new members
must fill out and file the renewal/joining form, along with a photocopy of
their current AMA card and the appropriate dues, in order to be admitted as
a new club member in good standing. The renewal/joining form is available
as the last page of these Bylaws, and on the clubs website (www.bsrcc.com).



For *existing members*, annual dues are due and payable on January 1 of the
calendar year for which their club membership is being renewed, and the
club encourages early payment of membership dues to the maximum extent
feasible. Additionally, if membership dues are paid "unreasonably late" in
a given year, then there is also a "late payment penalty" that is assessed
in addition to the regular membership dues (this is explained in more
detail in footnotes (1)-(5) of the table above). All existing members must
annually fill out and file the renewal/joining form, along with a photocopy
of their current AMA card, and the appropriate dues, in order to continue
as an existing club member in good standing. The renewal/joining form is
available as the last page of these Bylaws, and on the clubs website (
www.bsrcc.com).



Any proposed* changes to dues amounts* shall be first announced to the
membership in the monthly club minutes/newsletter. In a subsequent club
meeting, such proposed dues changes shall be reviewed, discussed, and
decided upon by majority vote of the members present at that monthly
meeting. If accepted by the membership, dues changes will then become
effective on a date as determined by majority vote of the members present
at that meeting.



*Special assessments*, which are intended to address emergency, unusual,
and/or extraordinary events, may potentially be proposed and accepted by
the membership from time to time. Such assessments are aimed at taking
care of necessary club costs which are both unanticipated and outside of
the normal annual budgeting process. Examples of such events might be the
replacement of a stolen lawnmower, having the field rent unexpectedly
raised, having to replace a field shed damaged by weather, or similar such
events. If special assessments are accepted by the membership per majority
vote at a scheduled club meeting, then the individual assessment amount
levied on each member shall be equal to the total special assessment amount
divided by the total number of members in all membership classes on the
club's official membership roster at that point in time (Note: "Honorary
Members" shall not be included in this head count, nor shall they pay any
assessments).



In deep appreciation for the flying site that it currently utilizes, the
BSRCC decrees that the flying site land owners (i.e., Ann Sweetman, John
Davenport, and Charles Davenport) shall enjoy Honorary Membership in the
BSRCC, in perpetuity, with all dues waived.



*ARTICLE VII --- VOTING RIGHTS*

Voting rights within the BSRCC is limited to only those members who are:
(i) eighteen (18) years of age or older regardless of their membership
classification; and (ii) fully paid up members in good standing (i.e., not
delinquent on dues).



*ARTICLE VIII --- GENERAL FIELD SAFETY RULES*

It is not feasible to make a complete and exhaustive listing of all safety
and operational rules that will make a model flying site function both
safely and smoothly. However, history and experience are of great
assistance in this endeavor, and the below list of items has been compiled
based on the BSRCC's many years of prior club experience. These rules and
guidelines are provided for the general benefit of all members, and are as
follows:

i. *All published AMA safety rules must be obeyed at all
times.*

ii. *All published BSRCC safety rules must be obeyed at
all times.*

iii. *If there should happen to be a conflict or difference
between the published AMA and published BSRCC safety rules, then the more
conservative of the two (i.e., the safest) shall take precedence.*

iv. *For any circumstance in which a safety rule has not
been published by either AMA or BSRCC, then the club member shall exercise
good, safe, sound, and mature judgement at all times (i.e., he shall always
err on the side of conservatism and constantly strive to reduce risk in all
matters related to safety). *

v. *To comply with AMA guidelines concerning frequency
management, the club has recently voted to go to "2.4 GHz only" transmitter
frequencies. Therefore, the older transmitter frequencies (e.g., 27, 49,
53, 72 MHz, etc.) are no longer allowed at the BSRCC field. A transmitter
impound area still exists, but is not required during normal day to day
flying sessions. However, the transmitter impound area may still be used
for funflys, flyins, competitions, etc. if the CD in charge determines it
is necessary. *

vi. No alcoholic beverages are allowed on the BSRCC flying
site at any time.

vii. No illegal drugs are allowed on the BSRCC flying site at
any time.

viii. Regarding the issue of flying while taking legal drugs or
medicines prescribed by licensed medical providers, the following is
offered as general guidance. If the prescribed medication does not result
in impaired mental or physical function, then the member may fly. However,
if the prescribed medication does result in impaired mental or physical
function, then the member shall not fly. In this instance, each member is
required to: (a) "self-certify"; and (b) to consult with their personal
licensed medical provider if any further guidance is needed to determine
the safe course of action.

ix. A member may fly only if: (a) they possess a current and
valid AMA card; and (b) their BSRCC membership is current (i.e., not
delinquent).

x. A guest or a perspective member may fly only if: (a)
they possess a current and valid AMA card; and (b) they are accompanied by
a club member in good standing. The host member is responsible for the
guest's flying actions while at the club.

xi. Before attempting to fly solo, new pilot members are
strongly encouraged to seek flying assistance from the more experienced
club members (i.e., "instructors") until they reach the point where they
can reliably and safely takeoff, fly, and land unassisted (i.e., "fly
solo"). The club has numerous experienced members who are willing to help
newcomers, and the following section (entitled "Recommended Solo Pilot
Qualification Procedure") is provided as general guidance to assist both
the newcomer and the instructor in determining when transition to solo
flight is appropriate, for both fixed wing aircraft and rotor wing aircraft=
.

xii. No motors or engines shall be operated on the spectator
side of the field's safety fence.

xiii. There shall be no more than five total fliers in the air
at the same time. When three or more pilots are flying simultaneously, it
is considered good practice to have a separate nonflying safety observer on
the field, if possible.

xiv. All AMA guidelines prohibiting flight over pilot, pit, and
spectator areas shall be rigorously adhered to. More specifically, when a
model is under power and flying in close proximity to the runway, the pilot
shall ensure that the flight path is not over these areas and is also not
directed toward them. That is, no flying aircraft shall approach the
runway under significant power with its flight path directed toward the
runway, pilot, pits, or spectator areas. (Note that this requirement does
not apply to the landing approach/turn which will also have flight path
momentarily directed toward the runway, pilot, pits, and spectator areas,
because such maneuver will typically be made at a significant distance away
from these areas and will also usually be at low or idle power setting.)

xv. All pilots shall ensure that their flying aircraft is well
clear of the pilot, pits, and spectator areas, and with flight path
directed away from them, in each of the following specific circumstances:
(a) during the takeoff run; (b) when a landing approach is missed and a go
around is necessary; (c) when repeated touch and go landings are being
performed; (d) when high speed, low altitude passes are being performed;
(e) when low level aerobatic routines or maneuvers are being performed; (f)
when any other flight maneuver is being performed that is in close
proximity to the runway.

xvi. As a standing rule, all pilots shall always be clear of the
runway during takeoffs, landings, low passes, touch and goes, or any other
maneuver which requires flying aircraft to be in close proximity to the
runway. If a pilot must approach the runway to retrieve an engine out
model, he shall first check to see if this is safe (i.e., no other flying
models in close proximity to runway). If it is, then he shall call out "on
the runway" when approaching the runway, and then "clear of runway" when
departing the runway after retrieving the model. This will enable other
flyers to safely avoid the runway during the period that the model is being
retrieved.

xvii. All engine out ("dead stick") landings shall have priority
to the runway. In this instance, it is considered courteous to call out
"dead stick" on the landing approach so that other flyers may immediately
yield the right of way.

xviii. Restricted air space shall be as posted on the field's
bulletin board (i.e., flyers shall not overfly the property of adjoining
landowners).

xix. At completion of a flying session for the day, the last
member leaving the field shall ensure that the main gate is closed and
securely locked.

xx. If any vandalism is noticed at the field (e.g., lawn mower
stolen), the observing member shall immediately contact a club officer for
further action (tel. nos., emails, etc. of club officers may be found on
www.bsrcc.com or on placards posted at the field).

xxi. If needed for reasons of safety, the above rules may be
revised and/or amended at any regular club meeting by a majority vote of
members present. If these rules are revised or amended, the new rules
shall be published and highlighted in the next issue of club
minutes/newsletter.



*ARTICLE IX --- RECOMMENDED SOLO PILOT QUALIFICATION PROCEDURE*

Like most RC flying clubs, BSRCC does not have a formal process for
teaching new members of the club how to fly model airplanes. Instead, this
process is handled informally with the more experienced members simply
helping the less experienced members become proficient and safe at model
building and flying. In this regard, the more experienced members are
usually referred to as "instructors", and the new members are generally
referred to as "students". This initial teaching process is justified for
reasons of both safety (i.e., to prevent possible injury to the student
and/or other persons at the field) and economy (i.e., to prevent expensive
crashes of the student's airplane or rotor craft). This teaching process
continues until such time as the student "solos" (i.e., becomes capable of
flying unassisted), at which time the "instructor" and the "student" both
become "members" again.



In an effort to assist both the instructor and the student in determining
when the student is ready to solo (i.e., ready to fly unassisted), the
following recommended guidelines and check list items have been compiled by
several senior members who have previously served as instructors. If the
student can consistently and reliably perform all the maneuvers listed in
the guidelines/checklist below, within an approximately 10 minute flying
session, under the overall supervision of a club instructor, then he can
have a high degree of confidence that he is ready to safely solo his
aircraft (i.e., fly unassisted and independently). These recommendations
are given below for both fixed wing and rotor wing aircraft.



*Recommended Guidelines and Checklist Items for Fixed Wing Aircraft:*

i. conduct appropriate preflight aircraft inspection
(i.e., mechanical checks)

ii. conduct appropriate TX/RX range checks

iii. controlled fuel up of aircraft

iv. controlled and safe startup of engine, and perform
required tuning

v. controlled and safe transport (i.e., carry) of aircraft

vii. trim aircraft to hands off straight and level flight

viii. perform counter clockwise horizontal rectangular flight
pattern

ix. perform clockwise horizontal rectangular flight pattern

x. perform figure eight flight pattern with turns away
from the pilot

xi. perform figure eight flight pattern with turns toward

xii. perform left landing approach followed by go around

xiii. perform right landing approach followed by go around

xiv. perform two controlled landings to full stop

xv. safe transport (i.e., taxi or carry) of aircraft from
runway to pits edge

xvi. safe engine shutdown procedure

xvii. safe TX/RX shutdown procedure

xviii. return of model and other equipment to pits area







*Recommended Guidelines and Checklist Items for Rotor Wing Aircraft:*

i. conduct appropriate preflight aircraft inspection
(i.e., mechanical checks)

the pilot

xvii. perform figure eight flight pattern with turns toward the
pilot

xviii. perform left landing approach followed by go around

xix. perform right landing approach followed by go around

xx. perform two controlled landings to full stop (i.e.,
landing approach, hover, controlled set down)

xxi. safe transport (i.e., taxi or carry) of rotorcraft from
runway to pits edge

xxii. safe engine shutdown procedure

xxiii. safe TX/RX shutdown procedure

xxiv. return of model and other equipment to pits area



*ARTICLE X --- CLUB MEETINGS*

Regular BSRCC club meetings shall be held on the first Tuesday of every
month at 6:30 PM, and at a location which is stated in the prior month's
newsletter and/or on the club's web site, www.bsrcc.com (note: meetings are
typically held at the flying field club house). Additional special
meetings may be called at any time by the club President, if necessary,
with prior notification to the membership.



*ARTICLE XI** --- RECORD KEEPING*

Treasurer and Secretary Records shall be maintained for a period of five
(5) years, after which time they may be disposed of. The outgoing
Treasurer and Secretary shall be responsible for transferring their
complete historical records to the incoming Treasurer and Secretary who, in
turn, shall be responsible for receiving and taking custody of same. This
transfer of records is usually done immediately following completion of the
annual financial audit (i.e., at the February meeting). All records are
the property of the BSRCC.



*ARTICLE XII --- SPECIAL COMMITTEES*

Special committees may be appointed by the President, when and if needed,
at a regular Club meeting. These committees shall operate under a specific
charter and for a specific time period defined by the President, and shall
be disbanded when their duties are completed.



*ARTICLE XIII** --- NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF OFFICERS*

Nomination and election of club officers shall be carried out annually as
follows:

i. Nominations shall be made from the floor at the
October Club Meeting for each officer position, and shall be made only from
those members who are in good standing (e.g., not delinquent on dues).
Additionally, a given person may be nominated for only one officer position
at any given time (i.e., no person shall be nominated to run for two
officer positions simultaneously). The names of those members nominated
for the various officer positions shall be published and highlighted in the
October meeting minutes/newsletter.

ii. Election of new officers shall be held at the November
Club Meeting, and the winners shall be determined by majority vote of the
members present at that meeting. The resulting new officer's names shall
be published and highlighted in the November meeting minutes/newsletter.

iii. The term of office for newly elected officers shall be
from January 1 thru December 31 of the forthcoming year.

iv. Transfer of applicable club records from the old
officers (outgoing) to the new officers (incoming) shall be carried out
after the annual financial audit is complete, usually in February of each
year.

v. There shall be no term limitations on any officer
position (i.e., a given club member may serve multiple times in a
particular officer position, provided that he is duly nominated and elected
each year by a majority vote of the membership).



*ARTICLE XIV --- AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS*

Amendments to the bylaws may be proposed at any general monthly meeting of
the Club. Any amendment proposed and seconded shall then be published and
highlighted in the next meeting minutes/newsletter, and shall subsequently
be voted on at the next regular monthly meeting. An Amendment shall be
considered approved if accepted by majority vote of the members present at
that meeting. Similarly, the Amendment shall be considered disapproved if
rejected by majority vote of the members present at that meeting. If the
bylaws are amended, updated copies shall be promptly sent to all club
members (by electronic means) and the AMA. The updated bylaws will also be
highlighted in the next monthly club newsletter, and also placed on the
club's website.



*ARTICLE XV** --- PROCEDURE FOR VIOLATION OF CLUB RULES*

Article II above states that "the purpose of the BSRCC shall be to provide
the physical facilities, safety rules, operational procedures, and general
management structure to enable the Membership to safely engage in and enjoy
the hobby of Model Aviation". *More specifically, implied within this
statement is the general club requirement that each and every member shall
adhere to accepted norms of societal behavior concerning safety, honesty,
courtesy and cooperation such that their actions will tend to enable,
promote, and assist all other members in engaging in and enjoying the hobby
of model aviation, rather than inhibiting, discouraging, and/or preventing
other members from engaging in and/or enjoying the hobby of model aviation.=
*



This Article XV, then, provides a mechanism to enforce the above club rule,
should it ever be required. This mechanism of enforcement will typically
follow one or all of the following three steps, which will be carried out
as necessary for reasons of safety or club stability:



(i) For a first time, minor, accidental, or inadvertent
infraction of the above rule, *the Club Safety Officer* acting after
discussions and concurrence with the Board of Officers will privately,
orally, and informally mention to the offending member what actions need to
be corrected in order to be in keeping with accepted club norms. It is
expected that the club member will then modify his behavior accordingly,
and the situation is considered over with. This step will require that at
least one club member in good standing have direct knowledge of the
infraction, and be willing to so testify.



(ii) For a second time, more serious, willful, or purposeful
infraction of the above rule, *the Club Safety Officer* acting after
discussions and concurrence with the Board of Officers will in writing
notify the offending member what actions need to be corrected in order to
be in keeping with accepted club norms, and that failure to correct such
actions in future will lead to his expulsion from the club. It is expected
that the club member will then modify his behavior accordingly. This step
will require that at least two club members in good standing have direct
knowledge of the infraction, and be willing to so testify.



(iii) For a third time, highly serious, or blatantly defiant
infraction of the above rule, *the Club President* acting after discussions
and concurrence with the Board of Officers will in writing notify the
offending member that he is to appear before the Board of Officers to
defend and/or explain his actions for not following the club rules. This
step will require that at least three club members in good standing have
direct knowledge of the infraction, and be willing to so testify and
discuss with the Board of Officers. Following discussion from the club
members in good standing who have direct knowledge of the infraction, and
defense/explanation by the offending member of his actions, the Board of
Officers shall decide by majority vote whether: (i) the offending member is
to be expelled from the club; (ii) the offending member may remain a club
member with no constraints/restrictions; or (iii) the offending member may
remain a club member but with certain constraints/restrictions as may be
prescribed by the Board of Officers. Whatever decision is reached by the
Board of Officers, such decision is final and shall not be subject to
question, negotiation, or further appeal. The decision by the Board of
Officers shall be clearly communicated in writing to the offending member.
If a member is expelled for serious or repeated infraction of club rules,
no refund of "unused dues" shall be made.



*ARTICLE XVI** --- **RESIGNATION OF CLUB MEMBERSHIP*

Any member may resign their membership in the BSRCC, for any reason and at
any time, by means of written notification to the club Treasurer (e.g., by
email, typed letter, handwritten note, etc.) at the same address used for
mailing annual dues. No refund of "unused dues" will be made upon
resignation of membership.



*ARTICLE XVII** --- **DISSOLUTION OF CLUB*

The Club may be dissolved at any time with the approval of the majority
vote of the then current Membership (i.e., delinquent Members shall not
vote). If such actions are taken, the Officers shall: (i) first, make
provisions for the payment of all the Club's legally owed debts; and (ii)
secondly, dispose of all remaining Club assets (if any) in such manner as
may be decided by majority vote of the then current Membership.



*ARTICLE XVIII --- FLYING SITE LAND OWNERS*

Not with standing any rule or bylaw stated above, the Flying Site Land
Owners (consisting of Ann Sweetman, John Davenport, and Charles Davenport)
shall have full, final, and absolute authority over

all matters regarding the flying site field and property, and utilization
of same by the BSRCC.
