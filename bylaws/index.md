## ARTICLE II --- PURPOSE OF CLUB {#ii}

The purpose of the BSRCC shall be to provide the physical facilities, safety
rules, operational procedures, and general management structure to enable the
Membership to safely engage in and enjoy the hobby of Model Aviation.


## ARTICLE III --- DEFINITIONS {#iii}

"Black Sheep Radio Control Club, Inc." shall mean the nonprofit model flying
club organized and incorporated in the state of South Carolina, USA. Street
address and field location are given above.

"BSRCC" shall mean the Black Sheep Radio Control Club, Inc.

"Member" shall mean any person who belongs to the BSRCC by virtue of having
satisfied all of the following requirements:

{: type="i"}
1.  he/she has expressed an interest in model aviation
2.  he/she has paid all required annual membership dues
3.  he/she holds a current AMA membership card
4.  he/she is also considered to be a person of good, honest, cooperative, and
    friendly reputation
    (i.e., has not been previously expelled by this or another similar club for
    infraction of stated club rules)
5.  he/she has expressed a willingness to participate, along with other club
    members, in any general field maintenance activities which may be
    periodically requested by the Field Marshall (e.g., the annual club work day).

BSRCC is an AMA Chartered Club and, thus, current and valid AMA membership is
required in order to be a BSRCC member. If a member's AMA membership expires,
then the BSRCC membership automatically expires as well. In this instance, BSRCC
membership can only be reinstated after AMA membership is reinstated. Individual
club members are kindly requested to conduct all their flying activities in a
safe manner (i.e., in accordance with all BSRCC and AMA safety rules), and to
project a friendly, cooperative, and courteous attitude to adjoining land
owners, the public at large, visitors to the field, and to all other club
members.

"Membership" shall mean the collective members of the BSRCC.

"He" shall mean in the remainder of these Bylaws the more correct term "he/she".
This is in recognition of the fact that those interested in model aviation may
be either male or female, and both are equally welcomed by the BSRCC.

"Majority Vote" shall mean the numerical majority of all members present at a
regularly scheduled monthly meeting.


## ARTICLE IV --- OFFICERS AND ASSOCIATED DUTIES {#iv}

Officer nominations are made at the October club meeting, notification to the
membership of those nominated for each officer position is made in the October
newsletter, and then elections are held at the November club meeting.
The term "Officer" shall mean a club member who is nominated and elected for one
(and only one) of the officer positions described below, by majority vote of the
club membership that is present at the November club meeting. Officers are
elected for a one year time period, and shall serve from January 1 thru December
31 of the forthcoming year. The officer positions of BSRCC, and associated
primary duties, are described below.

### President

The president shall preside at all club meetings, act as a spokesman for the
club, coordinate the duties of the other Club Officers, appoint special
temporary committees (including the audit committee) when and if they are
required, and act as an authorized signer (if necessary) of checks issued by the
Club. The president shall conduct his actions for the club in a democratic
fashion, strive hard to recognize, understand, and reflect the needs of all club
members, and in general be responsible for the smooth day to day running of the
club to the best of his ability. He shall also be responsible for the long range
planning necessary to ensure continuous availability of a suitable flying field
for the club. If the president is unable to attend a club meeting for any
reason, he shall appoint a Deputy (usually the Vice President) to act in his
stead.

### Vice President

The vice president shall act as Deputy for the President when he is not
available, and be responsible to the President for all other circumstances. At
each meeting, he shall give a report on old business from the prior meeting and
shall endeavor to have such business considered and voted on by the membership
in a timely fashion. He is also an authorized signer (if necessary) of checks
issued by the Club, and is responsible for the communications within the Club
outside of the areas of minutes and the Club newsletter. If the vice president
is unable to attend a club meeting for any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy
(usually the Treasurer) to act in his stead.

### Treasurer

The treasurer shall be responsible to the President, keep an accurate record of
all financial affairs of the Club, give a report at each meeting of the current
financial status of the club, collect and deposit all Club dues, act as liaison
between the Club and the Club's banking institution, keep an up to date record
of the clubs membership, and notify the club Secretary of membership
status (i.e., those members who are paid up, delinquent, have dropped out,
etc.). He may also act as an authorized signer (if necessary) of checks issued
by the Club. If the Treasurer is unable to attend a club meeting for any reason,
he shall appoint a Deputy (usually the Vice President) to act in his stead.

### Secretary / Newsletter Editor

The Secretary shall be responsible to the President, give a report at each
meeting of the prior meeting minutes (noting any changes or corrections which
may be required), take accurate minutes of the ongoing Club meeting, and publish
new minutes and the monthly club newsletter in a timely fashion. A copy of each
month's club minutes and newsletter shall be sent timely to each BSRCC member by
one of the following methods: (i) email (preferred method); or (ii) paper copy
(i.e., if that particular member does not have emailing capability). If the
Secretary cannot attend a club meeting for any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy
(usually the Treasurer) to act in his stead.

### Safety Officer

The Safety Officer shall be responsible to the President, ensure that all model
flying is conducted in a safe manner (i.e., in accordance with all AMA safety
rules and Club safety rules), and shall give a report on the clubs general
safety status at each meeting. Additionally, he shall be the first point of
contact with any member(s) who might fly in an unsafe manner, in hopes that
voluntary compliance with all safety rules can then be achieved. If not, he
shall report such incidents to the Board of Officers for further consideration
and appropriate action. If the Safety Officer cannot attend a club meeting for
any reason, he shall appoint a Deputy (usually the Field Marshall) to act in his
stead.

### Field Marshall

The Field Marshall shall be responsible to the President, and shall ensure that
all field safety equipment (e.g., spectator safety fences, impound area, safety
bulletin board, plane holding stations, plane assembly benches, pilot standing
areas, pilot safety fences, etc.) is maintained in such manner as to meet all
safety standards of both the AMA and the BSRCC. Additionally, he shall ensure
that all field maintenance equipment (i.e., lawn mowers, weed eaters, rakes,
shovels, etc.), and the field itself, are maintained in an acceptable condition
to accommodate the usual model flying. He shall report on the general field
status at each meeting, noting any deficiencies which are found, and shall
organize assistance from any and all other BSRCC members as may be required in
order to maintain the desired level of field maintenance for supporting an
active flying club. Note, it is expected that all members will respond
positively to any request by the Field Marshall for any assistance with field
maintenance work.

### The Board of Officers

The Board of Officers shall consist of the collective officers of the BSRCC
described above. In addition to their individual duties, the Board of Officers
shall also have the collective responsibility to collaborate and cooperate with
each other regarding the following global items related to club operations: (i)
all safety at the field (flying and nonflying); (ii) establishing and obtaining
membership approval of the clubs annual budget (usually submitted in January and
approved by the membership in February); (iii) day to day club maintenance,
especially runway condition; (iv) day to day club operations (flying and
nonflying); (v) planning and execution of all club flyins, funflys, and
competitions (if any), and sanctioning of same with AMA (if required); (vi) long
range planning necessary to ensure continuous availability of a suitable flying
field for the club; and (vii) to consider and take appropriate action on any and
all matters related to member discipline. The Board of Officers may authorize
club expenditures for any previously approved budget line item, up to the
approved amount, and any emergency expenditure up to $150 (e.g., lawn mower
repairs, etc.). However, any emergency expenditure over this amount must be
proposed, discussed, voted on, and accepted by majority vote of the membership
prior to making the expenditure.

## ARTICLE V --- ANNUAL AUDIT {#v}

The outgoing President shall at the December meeting appoint two sitting club
Officers plus one other regular club Member to audit the Treasurer's financial
records for the past fiscal year. This committee shall conduct its audit of the
records timely (typically in January), discuss with the past Treasurer as may be
needed in order to fully understand the clubs financial records, review its
preliminary findings with the past Treasure to achieve concurrence on the
conclusions, and then report the final audit conclusions to the club's general
membership no later than the February meeting. The Secretary shall publish the
audit results in the next club newsletter, and the audit committee shall be
automatically disbanded following completion of the audit report.


## ARTICLE VI --- MEMBERSHIP CLASSES, DUES, AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS {#vi}

BSRCC has *open membership* which is generally available to all persons
interested in model aviation provided they are of good, honest, cooperative, and
friendly reputation. The fiscal year of BSRCC shall coincide with the calendar
year, January 1 to December 31.

BSRCC has several *membership classes* available, and varying *annual dues* are
associated with each one. These classes and their associated dues are indicated
in the following table. All membership classes have equal rights with regard to
flying site access and utilization.

| Membership Class           | Annual Dues                   |
|----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Adult Member               | $75                           |
| Senior Member              | $45                           |
| Junior Member              | $45                           |
| Member of another AMA club | $45                           |
| Disabled Member            | $45                           |
| Family Membership          | 10% discount from rates above |
| Honorary Membership        | $0                            |

Junior Member
: A member who is less than 22 years of age if enrolled as a full time
student at an institution of higher learning, or less than 18 years of age
if not

Adult Member
: A member who is between the ages of 18 and 65, and who
cannot qualify as a Junior Member per above definition.

Senior Member
: A member who is 65 years of age or older.

Disabled Member
: A member of any age who has been diagnosed as "disabled" by a licensed medical
 doctor.

Member of Another AMA Club
: A full member of another AMA chartered RC club whose field is
located within a radius of 50 miles of the BSRCC field.

Family Membership
: Two or more members of any age who are legally related to one
another.

Honorary Membership
: An honorary and permanent membership which is conferred in
recognition of a person's exceptional service to the club.


If an existing member renews in January, February, or March, a "late payment
penalty" of $0 is added to the annual dues amount shown above. This is a grace
period granted by the club.

If an existing member renews in April, May, or June, a late payment penalty of
$15 is added to the annual dues amount shown above.

If an existing member renews in July, August, or September, a late payment
penalty of $30 is added to the annual dues amount shown above.

If an existing member renews in October, November, or December, a late payment
penalty of $45 is added to the annual dues amount shown above.

Annual dues are prorated for new members only, and do not apply to annual
renewal by existing members. Existing members must pay the entire year's annual
dues, regardless of the time of the year in which they renew. Any membership
which is not renewed for a period of 1 year shall be considered cancelled, and
shall be dropped from the membership roster.

For *new members*, annual membership dues are due and payable at the time of
joining. For the first year of new membership, dues will be prorated depending
on the actual month of joining (i.e., depending on how many months are left to
be "used" in that calendar year). For example, if a new member joins in January
then the dues for that first year will be (12/12)x(annual dues amount for that
applicable membership class), and if he joins in December then the first year
dues will be (1/12)x(annual dues amount for that applicable membership class).
All new members desiring to join the BSRCC must present the following
information for each person in order to be admitted as a new club member in good
standing.

{: type="i"}
1.  a completed new membership application form providing all information that
    is requested
2.  a photocopy of their current and valid AMA card
3.  a check for their applicable annual dues amount

The membership application form is available on the club's website at
[www.bsrcc.com](http://www.bsrcc.com/). The membership application is a one time
only formality which is required so that the club roster may reflect accurate
information for each member. Existing members do not have to resubmit this form
each year. The membership application form, a copy of the AMA card, and the
check for annual dues may be presented by either of the following methods.

{: type="i"}
1.  personally handed to any Club Officer at the flying field
2.  mailed to the current Club Treasurer.

The current Club Treasurer's contact information and mailing address is
available on the club's web site by clicking on "Officers".

For *existing members*, annual dues are due and payable on January 1 of the
calendar year for which their club membership is being renewed, and the club
encourages early payment of membership dues to the maximum extent feasible.
Additionally, if membership dues are paid "unreasonably late" in a given year,
then there is also a "late payment penalty" that is assessed in addition to the
regular membership dues. This is explained in more detail above. All existing
members must provide a copy of their current AMA card along with their dues in
order to continue as an existing club member in good standing. It is suggested
that existing members renew their membership as follows.

{: type="i"}
1.  Make a photocopy of your AMA card.
2.  Write on the front of it your applicable membership class.
3.  Attach a check for the applicable annual dues amount.
4.  Mail these items to the current club Treasurer.

Any proposed changes to dues amounts shall be first announced to the membership
in the monthly club newsletter. In a subsequent club meeting, such proposed dues
changes shall be reviewed, discussed, and decided upon by majority vote of the
members present at that monthly meeting. If accepted by the membership, dues
changes will then become effective on a date as determined by majority vote of
the members present at that meeting.

### Special Assessments

Special assessments, which are intended to address emergency, unusual,
and/or extraordinary events, may potentially be proposed and accepted by
the membership from time to time. Such assessments are aimed at taking
care of necessary club costs which are both unanticipated and outside of
the normal annual budgeting process. Examples of such events might be the
replacement of a stolen lawnmower, having the field rent unexpectedly
raised, having to replace a field shed damaged by weather, or similar such
events. If special assessments are accepted by the membership per majority
vote at a scheduled club meeting, then the individual assessment amount
levied on each member shall be equal to the total special assessment amount
divided by the total number of members in all membership classes on the
club's official membership roster at that point in time (Note: "Honorary
Members" shall not be included in this head count, nor shall they pay any
assessments).

In deep appreciation for the flying site that it currently utilizes, the
BSRCC decrees that the flying site land owners (i.e., Ann Sweetman, John
Davenport, and Charles Davenport) shall enjoy Honorary Membership in the
BSRCC, in perpetuity, with all dues waived.

## ARTICLE VII --- VOTING RIGHTS {#vii}

Voting rights within the BSRCC are limited to only those members who are
eighteen years of age or older, regardless of their membership class,
and who are also fully paid up members in good standing (i.e., not delinquent on
dues).

## ARTICLE VIII --- GENERAL FIELD SAFETY RULES {#viii}

It is not feasible to make a complete and exhaustive listing of all safety and
operational rules that will make a model flying site function both safely and
smoothly. However, history and experience are of great assistance in this
endeavor, and the below list of items has been compiled based on the BSRCC's
many years of prior club experience. These rules and guidelines are provided for
the general benefit of all members, and are as follows:

{: type="i"}
1.  All published AMA safety rules must be obeyed at all times.
2.  All published BSRCC safety rules must be obeyed at all times.
3.  If there should happen to be a conflict or difference between the published
    AMA and published BSRCC safety rules, then the more conservative of the two
    (i.e., the safest) shall take precedence.
4.  For any circumstance in which a safety rule has not been published by either
    AMA or BSRCC, then the club member shall exercise good, safe, sound, and
    mature judgment at all times (i.e., he shall always err on the side of
    conservatism and constantly strive to reduce risk in all matters related to
    safety).
5.  To comply with AMA guidelines concerning frequency management, the club has
    recently voted to allow only 2.4 GHz transmitter frequencies. Therefore, the
    older transmitter frequencies (e.g., 27, 49, 53, 72 MHz, etc.) are no longer
    allowed at the BSRCC field. A transmitter impound area still exists, but is
    not required during normal day to day flying sessions. However, the
    transmitter impound area may still be used for fun-flys, fly-ins,
    competitions, etc. if the CD in charge determines it is necessary.
6.  No alcoholic beverages are allowed on the BSRCC flying site at any time.
7.  No illegal drugs are allowed on the BSRCC flying site at any time.
8.  Regarding the issue of flying while taking legal drugs or
    medicines prescribed by licensed medical providers, the following is
    offered as general guidance. If the prescribed medication does not result
    in impaired mental or physical function, then the member may fly. However,
    if the prescribed medication does result in impaired mental or physical
    function, then the member shall not fly. In this instance, each member is
    required to: (a) "self-certify"; and (b) to consult with their personal
    licensed medical provider if any further guidance is needed to determine
    the safe course of action.
9.  A member may fly only if: (a) they possess a current and valid AMA card; and
    (b) their BSRCC membership is current (i.e., not delinquent).
10. A guest or a perspective member may fly only if:
    (a) they possess a current and valid AMA card; and
    (b) they are accompanied by a club member in good standing.
    The host member is responsible for the guest's flying actions while at the
    club.
11. Before attempting to fly solo, new pilot members are
    strongly encouraged to seek flying assistance from the more experienced
    club members (i.e., "instructors") until they reach the point where they
    can reliably and safely takeoff, fly, and land unassisted (i.e., "fly
    solo"). The club has numerous experienced members who are willing to help
    newcomers, and the following section (entitled "Recommended Solo Pilot
    Qualification Procedure") is provided as general guidance to assist both
    the newcomer and the instructor in determining when transition to solo
    flight is appropriate, for both fixed wing aircraft and rotor wing aircraft.
12. No motors or engines shall be operated on the spectator side of the field's
    safety fence.
13. There shall be no more than five total fliers in the air at the same time.
    When three or more pilots are flying simultaneously, it is considered good
    practice to have a separate nonflying safety observer on the field, if
    possible.
14. All AMA guidelines prohibiting flight over pilot, pit, and
    spectator areas shall be rigorously adhered to. More specifically, when a
    model is under power and flying in close proximity to the runway, the pilot
    shall ensure that the flight path is not over these areas and is also not
    directed toward them. That is, no flying aircraft shall approach the
    runway under significant power with its flight path directed toward the
    runway, pilot, pits, or spectator areas. Note that this requirement does
    not apply to the landing approach/turn which will also have flight path
    momentarily directed toward the runway, pilot, pits, and spectator areas,
    because such maneuver will typically be made at a significant distance away
    from these areas and will also usually be at low or idle power setting.
15. All pilots shall ensure that their flying aircraft is well
    clear of the pilot, pits, and spectator areas, and with flight path
    directed away from them, in each of the following specific circumstances:
    (a) during the takeoff run; (b) when a landing approach is missed and a go
    around is necessary; (c) when repeated touch and go landings are being
    performed; (d) when high speed, low altitude passes are being performed;
    (e) when low level aerobatic routines or maneuvers are being performed; (f)
    when any other flight maneuver is being performed that is in close
    proximity to the runway.
16. As a standing rule, all pilots shall always be clear of the
    runway during takeoffs, landings, low passes, touch and goes, or any other
    maneuver which requires flying aircraft to be in close proximity to the
    runway. If a pilot must approach the runway to retrieve an engine out
    model, he shall first check to see if this is safe (i.e., no other flying
    models in close proximity to runway). If it is, then he shall call out "on
    the runway" when approaching the runway, and then "clear of runway" when
    departing the runway after retrieving the model. This will enable other
    pilots to safely avoid the runway during the period that the model is being
    retrieved.
17. All engine out (dead stick) landings shall have priority
    to the runway. In this instance, it is considered courteous to call out
    "dead stick" on the landing approach so that other pilots may immediately
    yield right of way.
18. Restricted air space shall be as posted on the field's bulletin board
    (i.e., pilots shall not overfly the property of adjoining landowners).
19. At completion of a flying session for the day, the last
    member leaving the field shall ensure that the main gate is closed and
    securely locked.
20. If any vandalism is noticed at the field (e.g., lawn mower
    stolen), the observing member shall immediately contact a club officer for
    further action (contact info of club officers may be found at
    [www.bsrcc.com](http://www.bsrcc.com/) or on placards posted at the field).
21. If needed for reasons of safety, the above rules may be
    revised and/or amended at any regular club meeting by a majority vote of
    members present. If these rules are revised or amended, the new rules
    shall be published and highlighted in the next issue of the club
    newsletter.

## ARTICLE IX --- RECOMMENDED SOLO PILOT QUALIFICATION PROCEDURE {#ix}

Like most RC flying clubs, BSRCC does not have a formal process for
teaching new members of the club how to fly model airplanes. Instead, this
process is handled informally with the more experienced members simply
helping the less experienced members become proficient and safe at model
building and flying. In this regard, the more experienced members are
usually referred to as "instructors", and the new members are generally
referred to as "students". This initial teaching process is justified for
reasons of both safety (i.e., to prevent possible injury to the student
and/or other persons at the field) and economy (i.e., to prevent expensive
crashes of the student's airplane or rotor craft). This teaching process
continues until such time as the student "solos" (i.e., becomes capable of
flying unassisted), at which time the "instructor" and the "student" both
become "members" again.

In an effort to assist both the instructor and the student in determining
when the student is ready to solo (i.e., ready to fly unassisted), the
following recommended guidelines and check list items have been compiled by
several senior members who have previously served as instructors. If the
student can consistently and reliably perform all the maneuvers listed in
the guidelines/checklist below, within an approximately 10 minute flying
session, under the overall supervision of a club instructor, then he can
have a high degree of confidence that he is ready to safely solo his
aircraft (i.e., fly unassisted and independently). These recommendations
are given below for both fixed wing and rotor wing aircraft.

## ARTICLE XIII --- NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF OFFICERS {#xiii}

Nomination and election of club officers shall be carried out annually as
follows:

{: type="i"}
1.  Nominations shall be made from the floor at the
    October club meeting for each officer position, and shall be made only from
    those members who are in good standing (e.g., not delinquent on dues).
    Additionally, a given person may be nominated for only one officer position
    at any given time (i.e., no person shall be nominated to run for two
    officer positions simultaneously). The names of those members nominated
    for the various officer positions shall be published and highlighted in the
    October newsletter.
2.  Election of new officers shall be held at the November
    Club Meeting, and the winners shall be determined by majority vote of the
    members present at that meeting. The resulting new officer's names shall
    be published and highlighted in the November meeting newsletter.
3.  The term of office for newly elected officers shall be from January 1 thru
    December 31 of the forthcoming year.
4.  Transfer of applicable club records from the old officers (outgoing) to the
    new officers (incoming) shall be carried out after the annual financial
    audit is complete, usually in February of each year.
5.  There shall be no term limitations on any officer position (i.e., a given
    club member may serve multiple times in a particular officer position,
    provided that he is duly nominated and elected each year by a majority vote
    of the membership).

## ARTICLE XIV --- AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS {#xiv}

Amendments to the bylaws may be proposed at any general monthly meeting of the
Club. Any amendment proposed and seconded shall then be published and
highlighted in the next meeting newsletter, and shall subsequently be voted on
at the next regular monthly meeting. An Amendment shall be considered approved
if accepted by majority vote of the members present at that meeting. Similarly,
the Amendment shall be considered disapproved if rejected by majority vote of
the members present at that meeting. If the bylaws are amended, updated copies
shall be promptly sent to all club members (by electronic means) and the AMA.
The updated bylaws will also be highlighted in the next monthly club newsletter,
and also placed on the club's website.

## ARTICLE XV --- PROCEDURE FOR VIOLATION OF CLUB RULES {#xv}

[Article II](#ii) above states that "the purpose of the BSRCC shall be to
provide the physical facilities, safety rules, operational procedures, and
general management structure to enable the Membership to safely engage in and
enjoy the hobby of Model Aviation". More specifically, implied within this
statement is the general club requirement that each and every member shall
adhere to accepted norms of societal behavior concerning safety, honesty,
courtesy, cooperation, and friendliness such that their actions will tend to
enable, promote, and assist all other members in engaging in and enjoying the
hobby of model aviation, rather than inhibiting, discouraging, and/or preventing
other members from engaging in and/or enjoying the hobby of model aviation.

This Article XV, then, provides a mechanism to enforce the above club rule,
should it ever be required. This mechanism of enforcement will typically follow
one or all of the following three steps, which will be carried out as necessary
for reasons of safety or club stability:

1.  For a first time, minor, accidental, or inadvertent
    infraction of the above rule, the club *Safety Officer* acting after
    discussions and concurrence with the Board of Officers will privately,
    orally, and informally mention to the offending member what actions need to
    be corrected in order to be in keeping with accepted club norms. It is
    expected that the club member will then modify his behavior accordingly,
    and the situation is considered to be completely resolved. This step will
    require that at least one club member in good standing have direct knowledge
    of the infraction, and be willing to so testify.
2.  For a second time, more serious, willful, or purposeful
    infraction of the above rule, the club *Safety Officer* acting after
    discussions and concurrence with the Board of Officers will in writing
    notify the offending member what actions need to be corrected in order to
    be in keeping with accepted club norms, and that failure to correct such
    actions in future will lead to his expulsion from the club. It is expected
    that the club member will then modify his behavior accordingly. This step
    will require that at least two club members in good standing have direct
    knowledge of the infraction, and be willing to so testify.
3.  For a third time, highly serious, or blatantly defiant
    infraction of the above rule, the club *President* acting after discussions
    and concurrence with the Board of Officers will in writing notify the
    offending member that he is to appear before the Board of Officers to
    defend and/or explain his actions for not following the club rules. This
    step will require that at least three club members in good standing have
    direct knowledge of the infraction, and be willing to so testify and
    discuss with the Board of Officers. Following discussion from the club
    members in good standing who have direct knowledge of the infraction, and
    defense/explanation by the offending member of his actions, the Board of
    Officers shall decide by majority vote whether: (i) the offending member is
    to be expelled from the club; (ii) the offending member may remain a club
    member with no constraints/restrictions; or (iii) the offending member may
    remain a club member but with certain constraints/restrictions as may be
    prescribed by the Board of Officers. Whatever decision is reached by the
    Board of Officers, such decision is final and shall not be subject to
    question, negotiation, or further appeal. The decision by the Board of
    Officers shall be clearly communicated in writing to the offending member.
    If a member is expelled for serious or repeated infraction of club rules,
    no refund of "unused dues" shall be made.

## ARTICLE XVI --- RESIGNATION OF CLUB MEMBERSHIP {#xvi}

Any member may resign their membership in the BSRCC, for any reason and at any
time, by means of written notification to the club Treasurer (e.g., by email,
typed letter, handwritten note, etc.) at the same address used for mailing
annual dues. No refund of "unused dues" will be made upon resignation of
membership.

## ARTICLE XVII --- DISSOLUTION OF CLUB {#xvii}

The Club may be dissolved at any time with the approval of the majority
vote of the then current Membership (i.e., delinquent Members shall not
vote). If such actions are taken, the Officers shall: (i) make
provisions for the payment of all the Club's legally owed debts; and (ii)
dispose of all remaining Club assets (if any) in such manner as
may be decided by majority vote of the then current Membership.

## ARTICLE XVIII --- FLYING SITE LAND OWNERS {#xviii}

Not withstanding any rule or bylaw stated above, the flying site land
owners (consisting of Ann Sweetman, John Davenport, and Charles Davenport)
shall have full, final, and absolute authority over all matters regarding the
flying site field and property, and utilization of same by the BSRCC.
